# Suggestions
Concluding our review of measures of dependency and proposed dependency taxonomy, we provide three simple guidelines.  We believe that if followed, these suggestions will help to significantly improve dependency related research. The suggestions we make are 1) identify and report the theoretical foundation of how dependency is conceptualized, 2) match empirical measures employed with theoretical conceptualization, and 3) where possible, reference the network perspective of dependency.

## Identify and Report
Despite the fact that the taxonomy is specifically meant as a way to categorize indices of dependency, we propose that theoretical characterizations of dependency can be grouped into the same categories. We suggest that theoreticians should explicitly discuss how dependency in their theory fits into the taxonomy. For example, a study interested in the interdependency found in advice networks could have various theoretical conceptualizations for dependency. The theory could describe, for example, how the number of connections in an advice network could be an antecedent to performance, employing a magnitude focus to the theory. The theory could, on the other hand, be more focused with specific patterns that appear in advice networks, or the sequential nature of advice networks. It is even possible that the theory employs multiple such characterizations. 

We suggest that a researcher explicitly identify how theoretical processes involving dependency fit in relation to the taxonomy. We believe that this practice will help clarify differences in how the concept of dependency is characterized in a theory.

##Matching Theory and Indices
The second suggestion we make is to employ indices of dependency that match a theoretical characterization. Perhaps the most powerful result of the taxonomy proposed in the current paper is the ability to appropriately match theoretical representations of dependency with indices. If the theory describes a sequential-based process where chains of dependent relationships can cause issues, for example, we suggest that a sequential index of dependency should be the focus variable. If the nature of how dependency relationships relate to each other is important, an interrelatedness index is likely to be more appropriate. For rigor and clarity, we suggest that researchers provide a clear justification for why the given index matches the given theory.

We propose that it is often appropriate to use more than one type of index. Specifically, regardless of if a theory is focused on interrelatedness or sequentiality, the total magnitude of dependency is likely relevant. For this reason, we suggest that regardless of the main focus of the theory, it is likely appropriate to additionally use at least one magnitude index. 
In cases where very little information regarding how dependency is  characterized is provided, or when there is ambiguity, we suggest that empirical evaluation employ at least three indices: at least one team-level and one individual-level index, and at least one index from each of the three dependency structure types (i.e. magnitude, interrelatedness, sequential). The core principal is that dependency should be measured in a way that appropriately captures the theoretical representation.

If followed, the practice of matching theoretical representations with empirical measures has the potential to substantially improve the study of dependency. Where the theoretical significance of dependency may have been largely based on some structural characteristic other than magnitude, previously empirical evaluations of dependency usually employed magnitude measures.

##Network Perspective
The last suggestion we make is to reference the network perspective of dependency when describing the theory or measures of dependency. While, many of the indices reviewed in this paper are calculated using network indices, very little reference is made to a network of dependency interactions. We believe that the practice of explicitly describing dependency in terms of a dependency network will help further clarify dependency research. Furthermore, we believe that this perspective will help theorists to formulate new clear theories about the impacts of dependency on teams.

# Discussion
In this paper, we have discussed the importance of dependency to teams and team outcomes. Not only is dependency a definitional requirement of teams, but is a powerful tool for differentiating teams, and has significant impacts on team outcomes. Despite continual acknowledgement of dependency's importance to outcomes studied by organizational scientist, there has been no clear definition of dependency or framework that can differentiate between measures of dependency.

We contribute to the theory of dependency by describing how dependencies form relationships between objects and sources of dependency such that performance of the object is influenced by performance of the source. We further contributed to the theory of dependencies by describing how these dependency relationships within a dependency network could illustrate possible sources of failure or success in a team system. These relationships can also demonstrate how team members can facilitate or inhibit a team's overall performance. Most significantly, we have contributed to organizational theory by providing a taxonomy that can be used to describe dependency indices. This lexicon will be a tremendous stepping stone for future research and theory development of organizational dependency. This will also help to resolve potential conflicting results and promote unity in future dependency research communications. We make a final significant contribution by provideing guidlins that can help deturmine what indices of dependnecy may be most approprate in a given situation.

This paper has only briefly discussed the question of what dependency is. We have provided a definition of dependency and introduced a network conceptualization of dependency. It appears that  dependency can be interpreted as a network in a very natural way. We suggest that this network conceptualization may lead to formalized models of dependency, which could be used to further clarify the impacts of dependency.

## Future Work
This paper represents the beginning of a long task in distinguishing and describing dependency in organizations and their outcomes. While we feel that the taxonomy presented here covers the main characteristics of dependency indices, this framework is not nessisarily comprehensive nor complete. There are likely many more characteristics of dependency indices worth considering adding to the proposed taxonomy. Future research identifing dimensions that should be incorporated into the dependency taxonomy, would be valuable.

A systematic study of different types of dependency is an area of research that is greatly needed. We have proposed that dependencies are relationships that form networks between them. A thorough investigation of this theoretical interpretation of dependency and its implications is needed. Specifically, a review of different forms of dependency and the outcomes they are linked to. While the taxonomy provided in this paper can be used to distinguish potential types of dependency, it is focused primarily on distinguishing indices of dependency, and further investigation into how to categorize types of dependency is necessary. 

We further suggest that future work studying dependency will likely focus on dependency networks. The network conceptualization of dependency provides a formalized framework  for dependency relationships and appears to be a natural fit. The theoretical implications of a network perspective of dependency are rich and promising. 

We find it shocking that despite the large number of papers that reference the importance of dependency, there has been, to our knowledge, no systematic review of the literature regarding the impacts of dependency. It is our hope that the taxonomy provided in this paper will aid the study and review of organizational dependencies impacts. Specifically, we hope that a future categorization of dependency types will help drive a review that is able to systematically identify what the impacts of differing forms of organizational dependency are.

## Conclusion
We have contributed to the organizational sciences theory by providing a theoretical conceptualization of what dependencies are and how they form networks. We have furthermore contributed to organizational sciences by providing a taxonomy for indices of dependency and briefly reviewing and identifying examples of dependency indices.

Organizational dependency is not only an enormously important topic, but also a very promising avenue for research. There appears to be a bright future in the study of organizational dependency.
