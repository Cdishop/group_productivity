# Discussion
In this paper we have discussed the importance of dependency to teams and team outcomes. Not only is dependency a deffinitional requirement of teams, but it is a powerful tool for differentiating teams, and has significant impacts on team outcomes. Despite continual acknowledgement of dependency's importance to outcomes studied by organizational scientist, there has been no clear definition of dependency or framework that can differentiate between measures of dependency.

We contribute to the theory of dependencies by describing how dependencies form relationships between objects and sources of dependency such that performance of the object is influenced by performance of the source. We further contributed to the theory of dependencies by describing how these dependency relationships for a dependency network which could illustrate possible sources of failure in a team system or demonstrate how team members can facilitate team success. Most significantly we have contributed organizational theory by providing a taxonomy that can be used to describe dependency indices. This lexicon will be a tremendous stepping stone for future research and theory development of organizational dependency. This will also help to resolve potential conflicting results, and promote unity in future dependency research communications.

It is important to note many of the indices discussed in this paper could be applied to various forms of dependency providing means to evaluate various fascits of dependency in teams. These indices do not necessarily only work for the exact type of dependency they were originally designed for. There are various modes for assessing a teams dependency. We suggest that there will be value in cooperating structural measures of dependency with self-report and observational measures. We specifically advocate for more use of structural measures of dependency. While self-report and observational measures may be fairly quick and easy, structural measures may be able to help explain team processes in a way the traditional measures are incapable. 

We have not tested or validated the indices reviewed in this article, and we are therefore hesitant to make a definitive assessment of which measures should be used and when. We do suggest that a researcher identify based on the taxonomy which measures most closely fit with their goals and apply these indices. For example an a research interested in a individual level measure of dependency that accounts for relationships between person and task would find that IPCl and IPCd are likely the best options depending on if the structure or the volume of dependency is more important to the researcher. We recognize that the list or indices we have provided is short and may not provide the index needed in some situations. We hope that, this framework will encourage the investigation, and development of new dependency indices.

This paper has only briefly discussed the question of what dependency is. We have provided a definition of dependency and briefly discussed a network conceptualization of dependency, but this paper focused primarily on indices of dependency. It appears that there dependency can be interpreted as a network in a very natural way. We suggest that this network conceptualization may lead to a formalized models of dependency which could be used to further clarify the impacts of dependency.

## Future Work
This paper represents the beginning in a long task in distinguishing and describing dependency in organizations and its outcomes. While we feel that the taxonomy presented here covers the main characteristics of dependency indices, this framework is by no means comprehensive nor complete. There are likely many more characteristics of dependency indices worth considering. We suggest that future research may identify dimensions that should be incorporated into the dependency taxonomy.

Another area of research that is greatly needed is a systematic study of different types of dependency. We have proposed that dependencies are relationships that form networks between. A though investigation of this theoretical interpretation of dependency and its implications is needed. Specifically a review of different forms of dependency and the outcomes they are linked to is needed. While the taxonomy provided in this paper can be used to distinguish potential types of dependency it is focused primarily on distinguishing indices of dependency, and further investigation into how to categorize types of dependency is necessary. 

We further suggest that future work studying dependency will likely focus on dependency networks. The network conceptualization of dependency provide a formalized framework by which dependence relationships and appears to be a natural fit for dependency networks. The theoretical implications of a network perspective of dependency are rich and promising.

We find it shocking that despite the large number of papers that reference the importance of dependency, there has been, to our knowledge, no systematic review of the literature regarding the impacts of dependency. It is our hope that the taxonomy provided in this paper will aid the study and review of organizational dependencies impacts. Specifically we hope that a future categorization of dependency types will help drive a review that is able to systematically identify what the desperate impacts of differing forms of organizational dependency are.

## Conclusion

We have provided theoretical contribution to organizational sciences by providing a theoretical conceptualization of what dependencies are and how they form networks. We have furthermore contributed to organizational sciences by providing a taxonomy for indices of dependency and briefly reviewing good examples of dependency indices that we have identified.

Organizational dependency is not only an enormously important topic, but also a very promising avenue for research. We suggest that there appears to be a bright future in the study of organizational dependency.
