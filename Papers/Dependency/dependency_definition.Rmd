# Defining Dependency

The notion of dependency is referred to broadly. When describing task to task prerequisite relationships, dependency terminology is natural. For example, "I am depending on you get me the data so I can put together the graphs for the meeting." Likewise, the term interdependency is often used to describe individuals that rely on each other. Even when describing task assignment, the notion of dependency is appropriate. For example, "Your individual sales depend on your personal ability as a salesman."  It is startling to us that despite dependency's apparent importance to  individuals, teams and their outcomes, we have found no clear existing definition of dependency in the literature. Despite this fact, it has been used in studies as a core component of or even equivalent to various constructs such as interdependency, cooperation (rrr), coordination(rrr), collaboration(rrr), teamwork (rrr), task assignment (rrr), and task prerequisites (rrr), to name a few. 

For the purpose of this paper, we define dependency as \textit{A relationship between some object of dependency and source of dependency such that performance of the object is influenced by performance of the source of dependency}.  As it is used here, both the object and source of dependency may be an individual, position, or task. When a task that cannot be performed until another task is, the first task is dependent on the second task. In this scenario the first task is the object of dependency  and the second task is the source. Similarly, if two individuals work closely together in a team, they may be dependent on each other such that the performance of one affects the performance of the other. In this case, both individuals are objects of dependency because their own level of performance is dependent on someone else's performance; they are also sources of dependency because their own performance affects the performance of another. 

This is purposefully a general definition of dependency. We do not claim that this is the only way or the best way to define dependency; it is simply a workable starting point that is broad enough to encompass the numerous places where we have found the term used in the literature. The purpose of this paper is primarily to start discourse on the topic of dependency in collective performance by reviewing measures of dependency and providing a framework that can be used to evaluate the similarities and differences between various applications of the notion of dependency. Establishing a definition of dependency is a foundational point in this important discourse for two reasons. First, this definition will help to clarify why very different indices of dependency are considered measures of a similar concept. Secondly, this definition will serve to draw boundaries distinguishing what we consider dependency from other constructs.
