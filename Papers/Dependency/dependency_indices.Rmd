# Measures of Dependency
There have been many examples of indices used to measure dependency in the organizational sciences. In this section we will briefly describe a selection of these indices. The list of indices is provide in table 1 below along with information regarding how each fits into the proposed taxonomy. The indices are organized into three main groups biased on the source of data for each measure (Self-report, Observational, Objective Network Based). 

## Self-report Measures
By far the most common method currently used to measure dependency are self-report measures. These indices very in quality, length and what type of dependency they measure. Self-report questionnaires are by nature very much dependent on the ability of the individual in question to accurately provide the information requested and thus can be subjective. Despite their weaknesses, self-reports generally require minimal knowledge about the tasks and team structure, and require minimal effort to use. One self-report measure of dependency is the Self-Construal Scale (SCS) (rrr). This is an excellent example of a well-developed and toughly validated self-report measure of dependency. The SCS focuses on identifying how much an individual generally relies on working with other people and is essentially a personality measure. The object of dependency in the SCS is at the individual level. The source of dependency is the team network. SCS measures person-person interdependence relationships. The SCS's items are primarily facilitative in nature.

A second questionnaire measure for interdependence is Lee et al.'s (rrr) Team Descriptive Index (TDI). TDI measures team level independence on team level aggregations of horizontal and vertical dependence (Skill Differentiation, and Authority Differentiation). The Object of dependency in the TDI is as the network level as is the source of dependency. TDI focuses on measuring person-person type interactions. The TDI' items are primarily facilitative. 

## Observational Measures
Various observational measures of dependence have been employed including team interaction video coding (rrr), counting specific behaviors indicative of interdependence (rrr). Observational measures do not rely on the subject of a studies personal perception or understanding of concepts of dependency making these generally more objective then self-report measures. These measures typically require very specific training to identify behaviors very specific to a given team structure. This makes it difficult to make generalized claims from observational measures of dependence. These measures are various and fall into most of the categories described by the taxonomy we propose.

## Structural Measures of Dependency

### Collaboration and Coordination:
O'Brien proposed a three level system for describing teems with people (level 1) assigned to specific positions (level 2) which in turn are assigned specific tasks (level 3). In this framework O'Brien describes three forms of dependency and how they can be measured. These are 1. Inter-position Collaboration, 2. Inter-position Coordination, and 3. Inter-Task Coordination (O'Brien, 1967, 1968). 

O'Brien's (1968) concept of inter-position collaboration is a measure of the degree to which responsibility for tasks integral to a team is shared between more than one team member. Thus a team that has one task that each team member participates in would have a very high collaboration score, where as a team with one separate task for each team member would have a minimal collaboration score. The object of dependency in inter-position collaboration is at the network level. The source of dependency is likewise at the network level as it is an aggregated index accounting for all individual role task assignments. The inter-position collaboration does not account for task-task relationships thus this index so is categorized as person-person. This index could be used to measure either facilitative or prescriptive dependency relationships; the nature of this index is dependent on the nature of task assignments used to calculate it. The foundational network concept used her is network density. The greater the density of the role-task assignment network the greater the collaboration score.

The second index proposed by O'Brien is inter-position coordination. Whereas O'Brien conceptualized collaboration as a score of how much individuals must work together, inter-position coordination is an index of the extent to which ones assigned tasks must follow temporally the completion of another roles assigned task. The more often an individual has tasks that must follow another individual the more dependent they are on that individual. The object of dependency, as provided by O'Brien's work is network level; however, O'Brien's work could easily be adapted to provide an individual level object of dependency variation. The source of dependency is again the network. The dependency relationships account for person to task, and task to task relationships thus this index is a person-task-person measure. Given that the index is based tasks that must precede another task this index is prescriptive. There is no clear conceptual network foundation of inter-position coordination, but it is somewhat related to connectivity and transitivity.

Inter task coordination is the last index proposed by O'Brien. Inter-task coordination is a measure of task structure complexity. Each task can preced or be preceded by other tasks, this index is a way of formalizing a measure of the complexity  of this task-task structure. The object of dependency is given at the network level, as is the source of dependency. Inter-task coordination measures task-task relationships. The relationships are assumed to be prescriptive. Inter-task coordination is closely related to network concepts of size including eccentricity and path length.

### Syntactic, Work, and Logical Dependency:
The notion of dependency is of particular interest in the software development teams. Here dependency has been used to describe relationships between code, and relationships between different developer role on the team. Relationships between different code sections are considered task-task relationships because the individuals task is to write the given code. There are five indices which we will consider: Number of Syntactic Dependencies, Workflow Dependency, Coordination Work Dependency, Number of Logical Dependencies, Clustering of Logical Dependencies.

Syntactic Dependency is a name for what is commonly just described as a dependency in software development. Syntactic dependencies are instances where code from one file require code from anther file. Syntactic decencies often come in the form of instantiating a class, or calling a method declared in the source file. The number of syntactic dependencies is typically calculated using a software tool such as C-Rex (rrr). The object of dependency is often reported on the individual level though it could easily be aggregated to network level if a network level index was desired. The source of dependency is also on the individual level. Syntactic dependencies are a special case of task-task dependency relationship type, and syntactic dependency specifically describes prescriptive dependency relationships. The network science foundational concept for the index Number of Syntactic Dependency is the degree of the task-task network which is sometimes referred to degree centrality.

Workflow Dependency is based on the concept that the number of times code must be passed off between developers is indicative of the developers interdependency. A particularly complex project may, for example require each addition to the code base to be checked by various developers because it may influence the tasks they are working on themselves. Workflow Dependency is a direct measure of the complexity of the development team's structure, and indirectly a measure of the complexity of the product being produced. The object of dependency is the individual developer as is the source of dependency. Workflow Dependency is a measure of developer to developer interdependencies and therefore represents person-person relationships. Code is generally not considered completed until all who need to look at it do so, thus this represents prescriptive dependency. The network concept that is foundational to this index is degree-centrality.

Coordination Work Dependency is closely related to Workflow dependency; however, Where Workflow Dependency is an index of the formal pass offs required to submit code, Coordination Work Dependency incorporates informal coordination requirements that are present in any team tasks. The object of dependency is at the individual developer level, as is the source of dependency. Person to person, task to task, and person to task relationships are all involved in the calculation of this index making it categorized as person-task-person relationship type. These relationships are representations of informal trends and are thus facilitative in nature. Again degree centrality is the foundational network science concept behind the calculation of this index.

There are two closely related indices the measure the concept of logical dependency. When writing code some files tend to be adjusted together, likewise in general a team may have some tasks which are linked. There is no specific rule that says the two must be combined, but there is a hidden type of relationships. These relationships have been called Logical dependencies in software development. The first Logical dependency index is a measure of the total number of logical dependencies a file. The object of dependency is at the individual level as is the source of dependency. Logical dependency accounts for relationships between code and therefore this is a task-task dependency type. The informal character of logical dependency makes it inherently facilitative in nature. The number of logical dependencies index is, again, based on the conceptual foundation of degree centrality.

Clustering of Logical Dependencies is based on a network formed from the same logical dependency relationships as the previous index. Unlike number of logical dependencies, the clustering conceptualization of dependency takes into account interdependencies of files that the object of dependency is dependent on. The object of dependency is an individual file. Unlike the number of dependency index, clustering of logical dependencies uses the entire network as its source of dependency. The type of dependency relationship is task-task. Again, the informal character of logical dependency makes it inherently facilitative in nature. As its name suggests, the clustering of logical dependency is based on the network concept of clustering or transitivity.

## Network Science Indices
All indices of dependency that have been discussed that are not either observational or self-report are measures of a dependency network. While the indices that are described in this paper provide examples of how dependency networks have been measured in the literature, there are many more characteristics of networks that could potentially be used as an index of dependency when applied to a dependency network. While this paper is not aimed at giving a comprehensive list of network indices, we will provide a list of broad categories of network indices that have been or could be applied to the study of dependency and give specific examples in each category along with how they would fit in the taxonomy described. A note, these network indices do not distinguish between types of relationships and thus the distinction between task-task or person-person relationships, in addition to the distinction between prescriptive and facilitative depends on the way the depends relationships that form the network are defined. We will therefore leave out discussion of these characteristics when discussing how network fit into the given taxonomy.

### Size and Length:
The first category of network indices is in many ways the most basic, but may be the most important. For example, the length of a path of members that for a sting of dependency relationships seems to be a good measure of how problematic a dependency network may be to team performance. There are many size and length indices including eccentricity, radius, girth, diameter, longest path length etc. We will cover just radius however there are many other indices that could be meaningfully used to study dependency networks.

The Radius of a network give the shortest distance between any two members of the network. In a facilitative person-person network a high radius could indicate that individuals don't work together much, and communication flow may be slow. The object of network radius is at the network level as is the source.

### Centrality:
The notion of centrality is an important characteristic of a network, and has been involved in many of the examples provided previously. There are various forms of centrality indices found in the network sciences, but the common idea is that they measure how central or important a member of a network is. 

Degree-Centrality is the measure of centrality that has been used most commonly in dependency indices. In general Degree centrality is measured based on a simple count of dependency relationships that member has. There are variations that are standardized or account for specific types of connections within the network, the basic idea is the same. 

There are many other centrality indices which may be interesting to apply to the same dependency networks that, for instance, degree-centrality has been applied to. One example is eigen vector centrality which accounts for the importance of a member of a network based on the number of connections it has and the number of connections it those connections in turn have. Accounting for second order and above connections in the dependency network may have very interesting implications, but has to this point, to our knowledge not been done. The object of dependency is at the individual level, but this time the source accounts for not just neighbors of the origin but the network as a whole, thus the source of dependency is at the network level.

### Density:
Density is a measure of how many connection are found in a network in terms of how many are possible. In terms of dependency, density is a fairly strong measure for the total number of dependencies compared to the size of the network. A dependency network with a high density would be indicative of a team structure or task structure that has on average many dependency relationships per member of the network. There are other ways to conceptualize and measure density but generally it is measured as edge density which is a ratio of number of network connections to total possible network connections. The object of edge-density is the network as a whole, and the source of dependency is likewise the network as a whole. 

### Connectivity:
Is a measure of how well connected different part of a network are. In the dependency context the connectivity of the network may be related to the number of ways a chain of dependencies required for a given object may fail. Thus higher network connectivity would be indicative of more potential places for prescriptive dependencies to cause failures. Two common indices of connectivity are edge-connectivity and vertex-connectivity. Both indices would fit in to this paper's taxonomy in the same way. The object of the index is the entire network (though an individual level index could also be computed following the same concept). The source of dependency is likewise the entire network.

### Clustering:
The last category covers various network indices that broadly measure a networks propensity to form clusters. These indices are related to the notion of dependence because, highly clustered networks, may have complex dependency relationships. As with the other general categories of network indices there are many ways to both conceptualize clustering and measure it. One index is the three-triangle transitivity. This measures when one member of a network (call them A) is connected to a second (call the B), and likewise B is connected to a third member of the network (call them C) how likely A is to also connect to C. Perfectly transitive networks form clusters of members that are all connected to everyone in the cluster and no one else. This index is measured at the network level, and the source is likewise the network.

As second network clustering index which may be interesting to study in the context of dependency networks is clique number. Clique number represents the size of the largest group in network where each member of the group is connected to every other member of the group. In a task to task dependency network this could represent the minimum number of tasks that a team must be capable of accomplishing concurrently. The clique number is a network level index with network level source.
