# Review of Existing Dependency Indices

## Self-report and Behavioral Measures

### Survey and Questionnaire
By far the most common methods we have encountered that are currently used to measure dependency are self-report measures (rrr). These indices vary in quality, length and the type of dependency that they measure. Self-report questionnaires are somewhat limited measures of dependency; they are highly subjective, relying greatly on the participant's ability to accurately provide the requested information. Their popularity is likely due to their ease of implementation; self-reports generally require minimal knowledge about the tasks and team structure and require minimal effort on the part of the researcher to use.

#### The Self-Construal Scale (SCS) 
The SCS (rrr) is a good example of a self-report measure of dependency. The SCS focuses on identifying how much an individual generally relies on working with other people. An individual's interdependence and independence are essentially treated as a personality measure. Items related to one's need and desire to work with others, respect for authority and their independence are included in this Scale. (See table 2 for examples of items found  in the SCS). The SCS gives a single score for a person. This score describes the general nature of the participant's dependency relationship with others they work with. The greater an individual's SCS score, the stronger their dependency on others they work with. It is important to note that this measure does not consider how dependent other coworkers may be to each other and how their potential interdependencies can influence the participant. In addition, the score does not contain any specific reference to the tasks the participant performs.

The SCS is easy to categorize according to the proposed taxonomy. SCS is focused on how much an individual seeks to work with others or on their own. It is not related to any concept of sequential dependency or structural patterns. Likewise, it is not intended as an assessment of the entire team. SCS is an individual level, magnitude measure of dependency.

The SCS is a useful tool, in that it requires the researcher to know very little knowledge about the team, work environment, or job. It is a simple questionnaire that can be sent out; team structure and interpersonal relationships do not need to be analyzed directly. Though we have described the SCS as a self-report index, it is possible it could be adapted for a supervisor to fill out and conduct the rating if desired. The SCS also can be used as a point of comparison between individuals found in teams of various compositions.

SCS is fairly limited in that it can only be applied to interpersonal, general dependency. An entirely new scale would need to be developed if a researcher wanted to consider any other type of dependency. The SCS cannot directly measure the characteristics of a team structure or position and is not designed to be specific to one job. This means an individual's responses may reflect their experiences in various jobs over their lifetime, rather than at the time of interest.

Therefore, it is a reasonable index to use when measuring an individual's interpersonal dependency; it is less useful in measuring the dependent aspects of a specific job, team, or context.

#### Team Descriptive Index (TDI)
Lee et al.'s Team Descriptive Index (TDI) is a three-dimensional team index, which distinguishes between types of teams. Two of its three dimensions are directly related to horizontal and vertical dependence; as a result, these two dimensions (Skill Differentiation and Authority Differentiation) can be used as a measure of a team's overall dependence. This questionnaire assesses how closely team members rely on each other and how much they rely on direction from leadership. (See table 3 for examples of items found in the TDI). Unlike the SCS, the TDI provides a score for the entire team, not a single individual. Similar to the SCS, a higher score of either dependency dimension within the TDI is indicative of greater overall dependency within the team.

As with SCS, the TDI fits well into the proposed taxonomy. First, the TDI is designed to assess teams and not individuals. TDI narratively considers the structural patterns of dependency within a team. Although the amount of dependency is assessed, it is in terms of one of two specific patterns of dependency (i.e. horizontal dependency and vertical dependency). Additionally, there is no sense of sequential dependency at all. Therefore, we categories the TDI as a team level interrelatedness index of dependency.

TDI has various advantages. It can be used to compare the level of dependency between teams and categorize them accordingly. It can also be filled out by a manager or supervisor, potentially making it easier to use than a survey which must be answered by the members of a team.

The TDI, like the SCS, is not very flexible. For one, it is not easily adapted to other uses beyond categorizing teams. In addition, though it does not require direct access to the members of the team in question, the TDI does require extensive knowledge about the team or teams being measured.  
 
In sum, the TDI is a team interrelatedness index that appears to be a potentially powerful tool for measuring a team's level of dependency in two different ways: horizontally and vertically. Though it is not very flexible and requires expert knowledge, in the right situation it would appear to be an ideal tool for studying dependency.

#### General Survey Measures
Various other questionnaires have been implied as indices of dependency. These include everything from single item measures of how much one's job requires the collaboration of others (rrr), to other complex assessments of an individual's need for interdependence in the workplace (rrr). Self-report indices have certain advantages over other indices. Primarily, they are easy to apply. The use and practice of survey research is very well established, and typically has a low-cost impact on the subjects of inquiry. Similarly, these indices typically require minimal prior knowledge of the team and task structures. Survey measures also have the advantage that they can be very specific in their targeted type of dependency. For these reasons, it is our belief that self-report measures will, for better or worse, remain the dominant method to measure dependency.

Notably, survey indices of dependency can potentially fall into any one of the 6 categories of indices in the proposed taxonomy. We suggest that it may be generative to develop various self-report indices that can be used to explore the implications of the various categories of indices.
Despite the dominance of self-report and questionnaire research, we suggest that the study of dependency will be significantly augmented by the addition of objective measures of team behaviors, and team/task structural components. In addition to helping differentiate types of dependency measures, we hope this review will demonstrate alternative measures that can be applied in research.

### Behavioral Observation
Different observational measures have been employed to study dependence. Studies have observed behaviors such as helping/backing up behaviors (rrr) completion of shared responsibilities and general team interactions. These behaviors do not directly measure dependency relationships, but behaviors indicative of interdependency. For example, a team with a large amount of backing up behaviors (i.e. covering for a team mate when they are unable to perform their assigned tasks) clearly has a high degree of dependency because the performance of individuals in a team influences how well the other can perform. 

As with surveys, observational indices can be counted and measured so as to fit into any of the six categories of the taxonomy. Observations can easily be focused on either an individual or at the entire team making team and individual level indices easy to develop. However, we suggest that magnitude measures of behavior are likely more common than others because of the simplicity of a magnitude assessment. 

Just as the self-report and questionnaire measures of dependency tend to be very specific in how they measure and conceptualize dependency, observational measures are very specific in what they measure. For example, helping behaviors have been used as an observational measure of team interdependency with a very specific conceptualization of dependency. Helping behaviors are indicative that a team has formally or informally grown to share responsibilities for tasks. A count of helping behaviors will not directly inform a researcher about the complex task to task relationships that are important to a team; however, an observational count of time that individuals must 'pass off' a task to another individual in the team, may get at this task to task structure.

Behavioral Observation measures have several strengths. First, they do not rely on the subject opinion of a subject or manager like self-reports. With well-trained behavior raters and consideration of inter-rater agreement, these measures can be very objective.
Observational measures are also powerful in that they can target a very specific type of dependency. They have the additional advantage that they do not necessarily need to take any time from the subjects of the study.

To their detriment, behavioral observations also have some severe limitations. It is expensive and time consuming to identify behaviors of interest, train raters, analyze inter-rater reliability, and code behaviors. Certain behaviors can be automatically counted through computer programs; however, extensive work is still necessary to identify behaviors of interest and clearly demonstrate that machines are measuring the desired behavior. While each behavioral measure is different, generally these indices of dependence will have significantly higher overhead cost compared to self-report measures. 

We suggest that behavioral measures add a unique component to the study of dependency, but the cost of starting and maintaining an extensive behavioral observation study makes it prohibitive in some cases. Where possible, observational measures add a level of depth to the study of dependency that surveys have difficulty achieving; however, we submit that they are not ideal for every situation.

## Structural Measures of Dependency
It is important to note that structural measures of dependency are based on information that likely would need to be gathered in one of four ways: questionnaires, observed behaviors, subject matter experts, and team/job analysis. These indices differ from the indices previously described, in that the questionnaires or observed behaviors would be used to account for a structure of dependencies either between people and or tasks. By contrast, the indices previously described largely ignore the structure, and are based on counts of behaviors and perceptions about interdependency in teams. While structural measures may carry a similar upfront cost as behavioral measures, they typically have a much cheaper continuing cost.

For each index, we will provide a conceptual background and briefly touch on the mathematics used to calculate each index. This is not meant to be a comprehensive discussion of the equations. If the reader wishes a more in-depth discussion of any index provided, they are encouraged to seek out the original papers referenced.

### Collaboration and Coordination:
O'Brien proposed a three-level system for describing teams with those (level 1) assigned to specific positions or people (level 2) which, in turn, are assigned specific tasks (level 3). In this framework, O'Brien describes three indices of dependency. These are 1. Inter-position Collaboration, 2. Inter-position Coordination, and 3. Inter-Task Coordination (O'Brien, 1967, 1968).

#### Inter-Position Collaboration
O'Brien's (1968) index of inter-position collaboration (IPCl) is a measure of how much responsibility for a team's assigned tasks are shared between more than one team member. Thus, a team that shares responsibility for all team tasks would have a very high collaboration score. By contrast, a team with one separate task for each team member would have a minimal collaboration score. It is assumed in this framework that each person is assigned at least one task.

IPCl is measured at the team level. It essentially measures the density of assignments between individuals and tasks. Thus, according to the taxonomy, IPCl is a team level index of dependency magnitude.

This index is closely related to TDI's concept of horizontal dependency or skill differentiation. Consider a team of widget makers. You may have someone responsible for molding the widget parts, someone separately responsible for cutting out the widget parts from the mold, and finally a separate person responsible for putting the parts together. You also could have a situation where all the tasks are performed by everyone. TDI would describe the first situation as having a high degree of skill differentiation; this corresponds to a lower level of IPCl when compared to the entirely integrated team. As a different example, in a football game, when the defense uses a zone defense, players must defend an area of the field (i.e., a zone). Often, there is an overlap between each player's assigned zone. This causes the players to have a shared responsibility for the task (i.e., covering a given zone). On the other hand, a different style of defense called "man-defense" occurs when players must cover a single specific player from the opposing team; here, players have independent tasks. Zone defense will typically have an IPCl score greater than a man-defense pattern because there is a higher level of shared responsibility.

The method for calculating IPCl is fairly simple. IPCl is the ratio of extra task assignments to the total possible number of extra task assignments. Extra task assignments are task assignments above and beyond the assumed minimum of each task being assigned at least one person. For example, if a team has 3 members and 5 tasks, there are at least 5 task assignments made (each task must be assigned), but potentially all 3 team members could be assigned to all 5 tasks. This would bring the total task assignment count to 15 and the number of 'extra task assignments' to 10. Thus, a team where every task is assigned exactly once would have an IPCl of 0 and a team where every person was assigned to every task would have an IPCl of 1. The equation is given as follows:

Overall, the IPCl appears to be a powerful index of dependency. It is both conceptually simple and mathematically elegant. To our knowledge, this index has not been tested for empirical value, but it certainly shows promise. It does not require significantly more knowledge than the manner of task assignment. about how tasks are assigned, but not significantly more information than this. It could be easily calculated from information gathered from a supervisor interview.

#### Inter-Position Coordination.
The second index proposed by O'Brien is inter-position coordination (IPCd). Whereas O'Brien conceptualized collaboration in IPCl as a score indicating how much individuals must work together on the same tasks, coordination is conceptualized in IPCd as a measure of how much the tasks performed by individuals are related. When tasks have specific
pre-requisite tasks, there are coordination demands that require team members to perform the tasks in the correct order. IPCd is the ratio of these coordination demands that are held within-person compared to between person. IPCd is minimal when the tasks performed by one person are completely independent of the tasks performed by another person. That is, the IPCd is minimized when each person can perform their assigned tasks without regard to whether the other team members perform their assigned tasks. IPCd is maximized when every task that has a prerequisite is assigned to a different person than the one assigned the prerequisite task. For example, IPCd is maximized if every time some Task 1 must precede another Task 2, Task 1 and Task 2 are assigned to different team members.

IPCd is measured at the team level. It measures the pattern of how tasks that have prerequisites are assigned (and is essentially equivalent to a measure of transitivity or clustering). Thus IPCl is a team level index of dependency interrelatedness.

Mathematically, IPCd is simply a ratio. The numerator is the number of times a task performed by a specific person must be directly preceded by a task performed by the same person. The denominator is the total number of times a task performed by a specific person must be preceded by any other task.

The lower the IPCd score, the more inter-person coordination is required compared to within-person coordination. When there is no interpersonal coordination demand, the IPCd is a value of 1. When half of the coordination demands require inter-person coordination, the IPCd will be 0.5, and so on. Though not specified in O'Brien's original index, it may be worth defining the IPCd for a team where no tasks have any prerequisites. In these cases, we suggest assigning IPCd a value of 1. Essentially, this means that if no coordination is required, all the coordination is handled by the individual.

The IPCd is a more complicated index of dependency when compared to IPCl. It does, however, have the simple elegance of an index with inherently meaningful values of 1 and 0. In contrast to IPCl, it also considers inter-task relationships (e.g. Task 1 must come before Task 2) not just the impact of shared tasks (e.g. Person A and Person B both are assigned to task 1). Like IPCl, this index requires only basic team structural information and thus would be simple to apply. Overall, IPCd seems to be an appropriate index to use when inter-task relationships and task-to-person relationships are both important.

#### Inter-Task Coordination.
Inter-Task coordination (ITC) is the last index proposed by O'Brien. ITC is a measure of task structure complexity. Each task can precede or be preceded by other tasks; this index is a way of formalizing the complexity of this task-to-task structure. Tasks that have many prerequisites clearly have more "coordination" demands than tasks with no pre-requisites. Therefore, according to the ITC, a task that has a prerequisite with its own prerequisites will have a higher coordination demand than a prerequisite without any prerequisites. If Task 1 must precede Task 2, and Task 2 must precede Task 3 there is a higher coordination demand than if Task 1 and Task 2 both only must precede Task 3. ITC can be conceptualized measuring the coordination demands of a given task structure or as a measure of how many ways a chain of tasks can break down; i.e., "potential failure propagation". A higher ITC score indicates a long chain of tasks; therefore, this task structure would require a high degree of coordination, as there are more opportunities for the task structure to break down. Furthermore, if initial tasks are not completed, the entire chain is likely to collapse; initial failures will inhibit future task completion. 

ITC is a team level index. It is based on pat-lengths and object ancestry. Thus, ITC is a team level index of sequential dependency.

ITC is calculated as the sum of the path length between every pair of tasks (0 for any unconnected tasks). The ITC is maximized when tasks are strung out in a line such that  Task 1 precedes  Task 2, etc. This is because the disruption of any one task will halt all tasks after that task. ITC is minimized when there are no inter-task relationships; here, the sum of all path lengths between two tasks is 0. 

The values provided by the ITC are non-standardized, but it would be possible to divide an ITC score by the maximum possible ITC score. This standardization would be comparable to teams with different task structures and different numbers of tasks. It is important to note that caution must be taken when using the standardized index to compare different teams. It is very possible to consider the same task from a different level of resolution. For instance, according to one perspective leaving the room may be considered one task, whereas a different perspective describes this task in more detailed steps: Step 1. turn the doorknob, Step 2. pull open the door, Step 3. Leave the room. This index can only reasonably compare between teams with a similar level of resolution on a given task.


If potential failure propagation is important to your study, ITC may be a meaningful index to use; however, it is not set up to work with person-to-task interactions as well as task-to-task interactions. Additionally, the ITC is not necessarily usable as a comparison point between teams with different counts of tasks. This may make other options more ideal for studying dependency.

### Syntactic, Work, and Logical Dependency:	
The notion of dependency is of particular interest in software development teams. Here, dependency has been used to describe relationships between code and relationships between different developers on the team. Relationships between different code sections are considered task-to-task relationships because the individual's task is to write a given code. There are five indices which we will consider: Number of Syntactic Dependencies, Workflow Dependency, Coordination Work Dependency, Number of Logical Dependencies, and Clustering of Logical Dependencies.

It is worth explicitly noting that although these indices of dependencies have been applied specifically to software development teams and tasks, there is no reason why they could not be applied to other teams and tasks.


#### Syntactic Dependency Count.

Syntactic Dependency Count (SDC) is used to evaluate code's propensity to propagate errors and is the count of syntactic dependencies within a file or code segment. Syntactic dependencies are instances where code from one file uses the code from another file. The SDC can be calculated using a software tool such as C-Rex (rrr).

Given that SDC is based on a simple count of the total number of dependency relationships a file has SDC is clearly a magnitude index. SDC an individual index of dependency magnitude, but it could easily be aggregated to a team level index. 

While SDC comes from the field of software development, it is applicable broadly to organizational science. Code files that software developers work on are the tasks they are assigned. In this way, SDC is a measure of how much each task is dependent on other tasks.  If there is a bug in code from a project with relatively low SDC, it is not very likely that this bug will cause cascading failures in other parts of the code. However, if a project has a very high level of SDC, one small missed character could derail the entire project. This same concept applies to teams in other contexts. If tasks are highly reliant on each other errors or carry a large number of dependencies, they are capable of propagating throughout the entire team's work. In this way, it is very reasonable to consider a generic version of SDC that is not necessarily used for just syntactic dependencies.

An index of dependency that is based on a simple count of dependency relationships directly related to some task or person is a powerful and simple measure of dependency in a team. Though elegant, due to its simplicity, the SDC does not address higher order dependency interactions. Situations, where the overall structure and distribution of dependency relationships are important, may require a different index.

#### Workflow Dependency (WFD).
In software development, developers are often responsible for different functions of the code. When one developer finishes writing a segment of code, they will typically pass it off to other developers who work on related code to make sure it integrates properly. WFD is based on the concept that the number of times code must be passed off between developers is indicative of the developer's interdependency. A particularly complex project may require each addition to the code base to be checked by multiple developers because each new addition affects many parts of the code.

WFD is an individual index of dependency magnitude. The method used to develop the network used in WFD could be applied to an interrelatedness or sequential index, but WFD uses degree centrality making it a magnitude index.

WFD is a direct measure of the dependency of the development team's formal structure,  and indirectly a measure of the dependency of the product being produced. WFD is computed in two parts. First, a developer-to-developer interrelationship is incorporated into a network where the edges are weighted by the number of times a given developer passed off their work to another developer. Secondly, the WFD score for a given code segment is calculated as the maximum degree centrality (from the developer to developer network) for any of the developers who worked on that specific code segment.

WFD can be described in more general terms by replacing code segment with task. Thus, WFD is defined as the maximum degree centrality (in the interpersonal network) of any team member who worked on the given task. The idea of WFD has important implications for various areas of work and is certainly not specific to software development. WFD is maximized for a given task when that task was assigned to someone with maximal degree centrality in the inter-person network. WFD is minimized when all team members assigned to a given task have no connections to other team members in the interpersonal network.

WFD, as defined here, has the drawback that it is not very usable in comparing values between different team tasks.  This is because the number of members on the team will have a significant impact on the reported value, but there is no clear way to standardize this value. Additionally, WFD requires significant knowledge about how often members of the team must work together, and who has worked on any given task. This makes WFD difficult to use in many situations. On the other hand, WFD provides a powerful method to measure interdependency in the workflow of team tasks.

#### Coordination Work Dependency.

Coordination Work Dependency (CWD) is closely related to WFD. Where WFD is an index of the formal pass-offs required to submit code, CWD incorporates informal coordination requirements that are present in any team tasks. In a development team, if one developer needs to use specific functionality, they will likely need to informally consult with the developer in charge of that functionality. CWD is a way of leveraging knowledge about how tasks are related in order to understand dependency within the team.

CWD is an individual index of dependency magnitude. The method used to develop the network used in CWD could be applied to an interrelatedness or sequential index, but like WFD it was originally defined using a magnitude characteristic of this network.

CWD uses a different method to construct the interpersonal dependency network; however, CWD and WFD are mathematically equivalent. In WFD, the person-to-person network is built out of how many formal interactions team-members have; the person-to-person relationships in CWD are built based on the amount that tasks assigned to individuals relate to each other.

The limitations and advantages of CWD are similar to those of WFD. The main differentiating point is that CWD will be built using the assessment of informal task relatedness, whereas WFD will be built using the formalized inter-person workflow relationships. They may have drastically different implications for outcomes, so there is merit in calculating both indices.

#### Clustering of Logical Dependency.
When writing code, some files tend to be adjusted together. Likewise, a team may have some tasks which are typically performed together without any specific rule that says the two tasks should be related. These relationships have been called logical dependencies in software development. The original concept is that code files change simultaneously typically are related in some way, even if there is not necessarily a syntactic connection between the two files. As files can be considered a special form of task, I will describe the CLD in terms of tasks. Clustering of Logical Dependency (CLD) is an index of dependency that accounts for how often tasks dependent on a central task are themselves dependent on each other. A higher CLD score indicates that tasks are likely to form clusters of highly interdependent tasks.

CLD clearly is a measure of dependency interrelatedness. This is because it is based on clustering, a network pattern characteristic. CLD is originally adapted as an individual level index, but could easily be aggregated to the team level. 

Theoretically, clustering of dependencies may impact the performance of a team in various ways. For example, consider a team that has a perfectly clustered pattern of dependency.
The tasks assigned to this team can be split between groups of completely interdependent tasks. The capability of delineating interdependent task groups could enable a team to allocate the tasks such that people that work together well are assigned to related tasks. By contrast, in a team where tasks are not highly clustered, it may be difficult to strategically assign tasks in such a promising way. In this way, it is possible that a high CLD could be associated with increased performance.


On the other hand, clustering may actually amplify the effects of failures. Let us consider three tasks such that Task 2 and Task 3 are dependent on Task 1 and also dependent on each other. Task 1 failure would likely hurt the performance of Task 2 and Task 3. Given that Task 2 and Task 3 are interdependent, there may also be a second order impact of the initial failure. Diminished performance on Task 2 would hinder Task 3's performance. Due to their reciprocal relationship, Task 3's poor performance, would further result in diminished performance on Task 2. Thus, greater levels of CLD could be associated with the amplification of impacts from changes in performance.
CLD is calculated as the ratio of links between neighbors of a central task, to possible links between neighbors of the central task. CLD is maximized when every prerequisite task is interconnected. CLD is minimized when there are no inter-connections between a central task's pre-requisite tasks.

One appeal of CLD is that it holds meaningful values of 0 and 1. CLD provides a value that can be reasonably used to compare differing teams. CLD provides a method for investigating the impact of unique facets of how teams and tasks can be interdependent.

#### Number of Logical Dependencies.
Number of Logical Dependencies (NLD) is an index of the total number of logical dependencies a file has. The more logical dependencies a piece of code has the more sources of error it could draw from, and also the more difficult it is to fix problems. This is because a piece of code with a large number of logical dependencies has a large number of other places in the code that updating it could impact.

As with SDC, NLD is an individual index of dependency magnitude, but it could easily be aggregated to a team level index. In fact, calculating NLD is identical in practice to SDC with the exception that logical dependencies are used instead of syntactic dependencies. NLD is applied to the same dependency relationships that CLD.
