# Dependency Indices

## Self-report and Behavioral Measures

### Survey and Questionnaire
By far the most common methods we have encountered that are currently used to measure dependency are self-report measures (rrr). These indices very in quality, length and what type of dependency they measure. Self-report questionnaires are by nature dependent on the ability of the individual in question to accurately provide the information requested and thus can be very subjective. Despite their limitations, self-reports generally require minimal knowledge about the tasks and team structure, and require minimal effort on the part of the researcher to use.

#### The Self-Construal Scale (SCS) 
The SCS (rrr) is a good example of a self-report measure of dependency. The SCS focuses on identifying how much an individual generally relies on working with other people. An individual's interdependence and independence are essentially treated as a personality measure. Items related to one's need and desire to work with others, respect for authority, and their independence are included in this Scale. (See table 2 for examples of items found in the SCS). The SCS gives a single score for a person describing the general nature of their dependency relationship with others they work with and has no reference to how these individuals may be interdependent or any specific reference to the tasks they perform. The greater an individual's SCS score, the stronger their conceptual dependency on others they work with.

The SCS has the advantage that that very little knowledge about the team, work environment, or job is necessary to use it. It is a simple questionnaire that can be sent out; team structure and interpersonal relationships do not need to be analyzed directly. Though the SCS is designed as a self-report index, it is possible it could be adapted for a supervisor to fill out and conduct the rating if desired. The SCS also can be used as a point of comparison between individuals found in teams of various compositions.

The SCS is fairly limited in that it can only be applied to interpersonal, general dependency. An entirely new scale would need to be developed if a researcher wanted to consider any other type of dependency. The SCS cannot directly measure characteristics of a team structure or position and is not designed to be specific to one job. This means an individual's responses may reflect their experiences in various jobs over their lifetime. 

These strengths and weaknesses make it a reasonable index to use, but only when measuring an individual's interpersonal dependency, not in terms of a specific job, team, or context.

#### Team Descriptive Index (TDI)
The original intended use of Lee et al.'s Team Descriptive Index (TDI) is to distinguish between types of teams, and it does this by providing a three dimensional team index. Two of the three dimensions are directly related to the notion of horizontal and vertical dependence; these two dimensions (Skill Differentiation and Authority Differentiation) can be used as a measure of a team's overall dependence. Essentially, this questionnaire will provide values that describe how closely a team is reliant on each other and how much they are reliant on direction from leadership. (See table 3 for examples of items found in the TDI). Unlike the SCS, the TDI provides a score for the entire team, not a single individual. Similar to the SCS, a higher score of either dependency dimension within the TDI is indicative of greater overall dependency within the team.

The TDI has various advantages. It can be used to categorize different types of teams, comparing the level of dependency between teams. It does not require direct access to the members of the team in question, but does require knowledge of the team or teams. It can be filled out by a manager or supervisor, potentially making it easier to use than a survey which must be answered by the members of a team. 

The TDI, like the SCS, is not very flexible. It could not be easily adapted to other uses beyond its original intended use. Another potential drawback is that, as stated above, it requires significant knowledge about the team or teams being studied.

The TDI appears to be a potentially powerful tool for measuring a team's level of dependency in two different ways. This tool is not very flexible, and requires expert knowledge, but in the right situation appears to be an ideal tool for studying dependency.

#### General Survey Measures
Various other questionnaires have been implied as an index of dependency. These include everything from single item measures of how much one's job requires the collaboration of others (rrr), to other complex assessments of an individual's need for interdependence in the work place (rrr). While we suggest that indices that objectively look at the structure of a team and its task are more objective than self-report measures, these indices have certain advantages. Primarily, they are easy to apply. The use and practice of survey research is very well established, and typically has a low-cost impact on the subjects of inquiry. Similarly, these indices typically require minimal fore-knowledge of the team and task structures. Survey measures also have the advantage that they can be very specific in their targeted type of dependency. For these reasons, it is our belief that self-report measures will, for better or worse, remain the dominant method to measure dependency. 

Despite the dominance of self-report and questionnaire research, we suggest that the study of dependency will be significantly augmented by the addition of objective measures of team behaviors, and team/task structural components. In addition to helping differentiate types of dependency measures, we hope this review will demonstrate alternative measures that can be applied in research.

### Behavioral Observation
Different observational measures have been employed to study dependence. Studies have observed behaviors such as helping/backing up behaviors (rrr) completion of shared responsibilities, and general team interactions. These behaviors do not directly measure dependency relationships, but behaviors indicative of interdependency. For example, a team with a large amount of backing up behaviors clearly has a high degree of dependency in that the performance of individuals in a team influences how well the other can perform. 

Just as the self-report and questionnaire measures of dependency tend to be very specific in how they measure and conceptualize dependency, observational measures are very specific in what they measure. For example, helping behaviors have been used as an observational measure of team interdependency with a very specific conceptualization of dependency. Helping behaviors are indicative that a team has formally or informally grown to share responsibilities for tasks. A count of helping behaviors will not directly inform a researcher about the complex task to task relationships that are important to a team; however, an observational count of time that individuals must 'pass off' a task to another individual in the team, may get at this task to task structure.

Behavioral Observation measures have several strengths. First, they do not rely on the subject opinion of a subject or manager like questionnaires do. With well-trained behavior raters, and inter-rater agreement being assessed, these measures can be very objective. Observational measures are also powerful in that they can target a very specific type of dependency. They have the additional advantage that they do not necessarily need to take any time from the subjects of the study. 

Behavioral observations also have some severe limitations. It is expensive and time consuming to identify behaviors of interest, train raters, analyze inter-rater reliability, and code behaviors. Certain behaviors can be automatically counted through computer programs; however, work is still necessary to identify behaviors of interest and clearly demonstrate that machines are measuring the desired behavior. While each behavioral measure is different, generally these indices of dependence will have significantly higher overhead cost as compared to self-report measures. While structural measures may have a similar upfront cost to use, behavioral measures will typically have a much higher continuing cost.

We suggest that behavioral measures add a unique component to the study of dependency, but the cost of starting and maintaining an extensive behavioral observation study makes it prohibitive in some cases. Where possible, observational measures add a level of depth to the study of dependency that surveys have difficulty achieving, but they are not ideal for every situation.

## Structural Measures of Dependency
It is important to note that structural measures of dependency are based on information that likely would need to be gathered in one of four ways: questionnaires, observed behaviors, subject matter experts, and team/job analysis. These indices differ from the indices previously described, in that the questionnaires or observed behaviors would be used to account for a structure of dependencies either between people and or tasks. By contrast, the indices previously described largely ignore the structure, and are based on counts of behaviors and perceptions about interdependency in teams.

For each index, we will provide a conceptual background, but only briefly touch on the mathematics used to calculate each index. This is not meant to be a comprehensive discussion of the equations. If the reader wishes a more in depth discussion of any index provided, they are encouraged to seek out the original papers referenced.

### Collaboration and Coordination:
O'Brien proposed a three-level system for describing teams with those (level 1) assigned to specific positions or people (level 2) which, in turn, are assigned specific tasks (level 3). In this framework O'Brien describes three indices of dependency. These are: 1. Inter-position Collaboration, 2. Inter-position Coordination, and 3. Inter-Task Coordination (O'Brien, 1967, 1968).

#### Inter-Position Collaboration
O'Brien's (1968) index of inter-position collaboration (IPCl) is a measure of how much responsibility for a team's assigned tasks are shared between more than one team member. Thus, a team that shares responsibility for all team tasks would have a very high collaboration score. By contrast, a team with one separate task for each team member would have a minimal collaboration score. It is assumed in this framework that each person is assigned at least one task. 

This index is closely related to the TDI's concept of horizontal dependency, or skill differentiation. Consider a team of widget makers. You may have someone responsible for molding the widget parts, someone separately responsible for cutting out the widget parts from the mold, and finally a separate person responsible for putting the parts together. You also could have a situation where all the tasks are performed by everyone. TDI would describe the first situation as having a higher degree of skill differentiation; this corresponds to a lower level of IPCl when compared to the entirely integrated team. Or, in a football game, when the defense uses a zone defense, there is typically overlap between assigned zones causing shared responsibility for the task of coving the given zone (or players in the zone). A zone defense will thus typically have an IPCl score greater than a man-defense pattern where each player has an independent task to cover one specific player.

The method for calculating IPCl is fairly simple. IPCl is the ratio of extra task assignments to the total possible number of extra tasks assignments. By extra task assignments, we mean task assignments above and beyond the assumed minimum of each task being assigned at least one person. Thus, a team where every task is assigned exactly once would have an IPCl of 0 and a team where every person was assigned to every task would have an IPCl of 1. The equation is given as follows:

Overall, the IPCl appears to be a powerful index of dependency. It is both conceptually simple and mathematically elegant. To our knowledge, this index has not been tested for empirical value, but it certainly shows promise. It does require knowledge about how tasks are assigned, but not significantly more information than this. It could be easily calculated from information gathered from a supervisor interview.

#### Inter-Position Coordination
The second index proposed by O'Brien is inter-position coordination (IPCd). Whereas O'Brien conceptualized collaboration in IPCl as a score indicating how much individuals must work together on the same tasks, coordination is conceptualized in IPCd as a measure of how much the tasks performed by individuals are related. When tasks have specific pre-requisite tasks, there are coordination demands that require team members to perform the tasks in the correct order. IPCd is the ratio of these coordination demands that are held within person compared to between person. IPCd is minimal when the tasks performed by one person are completely independent from the tasks performed by another person such that each person can perform their assigned tasks, regardless of if the other team members perform their assigned tasks. IPCd is maximized when every task that has a prerequisite is assigned to a different person than the one assigned the prerequisite task.

Mathematically, IPCd is the ratio between the number of times a task performed by a specific person must be directly preceded by a task performed by the same person to the total number of times a task performed by a specific person must be preceded by any other task. 

The lower the IPCd score, the more inter-person coordination is required compared to within-person coordination. When there is no interpersonal coordination demand, this IPCd will give a value of 1. When half of the coordination demands require inter-person coordination the IPCd will be 0.5, and so on. Though not specified in O'Brien's original index, it may be worth defining the IPCd for a team where no tasks have prerequisite tasks as 1 essentially stating that if no coordination is required, all the coordination is handled within the individual.

IPCd is a more complicated index of dependency when compared to IPCl. It does, however, have the simple elegance of an index with inherently meaningful values of 1 and 0. It also considers inter-task relationships, not just the impact-shared tasks. Like IPCl, this index requires only basic team structural information and thus would be simple to apply. Overall, IPCd seems to be an appropriate index to use when inter-task relationships and task-to-person relationships are both important.

#### Inter-Task Coordination
Inter-Task coordination (ITC) is the last index proposed by O'Brien. ITC is a measure of task structure complexity. Each task can precede or be preceded by other tasks; this index is a way of formalizing the complexity of this task-to-task structure. Tasks that have many prerequisites clearly have more 'coordination' demands than tasks with no pre-requisites. Likewise, according to the ITC, a task that has a prerequisite with its own prerequisites will have a higher coordination demand than a prerequisite without.  ITC can be conceptualized as a measure of the coordination demands a given task structure has or as a measure of how many ways a chain of tasks can break down, which can be termed as potential failure propagation. A higher ITC score indicates a task structure that would be more completely inhibited by failure to complete a task.

ITC is calculated as the sum of the path length between every pair of tasks (0 for any unconnected tasks). This is maximized when tasks are strung out in a line such that t1 precedes t2, etc. This is because the disruption of any one task will halt all tasks after that task. ITC is minimized when there are no inter-task relationships so that the sum of all path lengths between two tasks is 0. The values provided by the ITC are non-standardized, but it would be possible to divide an ITC score by the maximum possible ITC score. This standardization  would be comparable to teams with different task structures and different numbers of tasks. It is important to note that caution must be taken when using the standardized index to compare different teams. It is very possible to consider tasks from a different level of resolution such that in one team I may consider very fine detailed tasks (1. turn the door knob,  2. pull open the door, 3. Leave the room) where as in a different team the tasks may be described from a broader level (1. leave the room). This index can only reasonably used to compare between teams with a similar level of resolution describing the teams assigned tasks.

If potential failure propagation is important to your study, ITC may be a meaningful index to use; however it is not set up to work with person-to-task interactions as well as task-to-task interactions. Additionally, the ITC is not necessarily usable as a comparison point between teams with different counts of tasks. This may make other options more ideal for studying dependency.

### Syntactic, Work, and Logical Dependency:
The notion of dependency is of particular interest in software development teams. Here, dependency has been used to describe relationships between code and relationships between different developer persons on the team. Relationships between different code sections are considered task-to-task relationships because the individual's task is to write the given code. There are five indices which we will consider: Number of Syntactic Dependencies, Workflow Dependency, Coordination Work Dependency, Number of Logical Dependencies, and Clustering of Logical Dependencies.

It is worth explicitly noting that although these indices of dependencies have been applied specifically to software development teams and tasks, there is no reason why they could not be applied to other teams and tasks.

#### Syntactic Dependency Count
Syntactic Dependency Count (SDC) is used to evaluate code's propensity to propagate errors and is the count of syntactic dependencies within a file or code segment. Syntactic dependencies are often referred to as simply dependencies by software developers. Dependencies are instances where code from one file uses code from another file. The SDC can be calculated using a software tool such as C-Rex (rrr). 

While SDC comes from the field of software development, it is applicable broadly to organizational science. Code files that software developers work on are the tasks they are assigned. In this way SDC is a measure of how much each task is dependent on other tasks. If there is a bug in code from a project with relatively low SDC, it is not very likely that this bug will cause cascading failures in other parts of the code. However if a project has a very high level of SDC, one small missed character could derail the entire project. This same concept applies in teams performing generic tasks. If tasks are highly reliant on each other errors, or have a large number of dependences, they are capable of propagating throughout the entire team's work. In this way it is very reasonable to consider a generic version of SDC that is not necessarily used for just syntactic dependencies.

An index of dependency that is based on a simple count of dependency relationships directly related to some task or person is a powerful and simple measure of dependency in a team. Despite it's apparent elegant simplicity, SDC does not address higher order dependency interactions which may play an important role in the impact of dependency. Situations where the overall structure and distribution of dependency relationships is important may require a different index.

#### Workflow Dependency (WFD)
In software development, developers are often responsible for different functions of code. When one developer finishes writing a segment of code, they will typically pass it off to other developers who work on related code to make sure it integrates properly. WFD is based on the concept that the number of times code must be passed off between developers is indicative of the developer's interdependency. A particularly complex project may require each addition to the code base to be checked by multiple developers, because each new addition affects many parts of the code.

WFD is a direct measure of the complexity of the development team's formal structure, and indirectly a measure of the complexity of the product being produced. WFD is computed in two parts. First, a developer-to-developer interrelationship is incorporated into a network where the edges are weighted by the number of times a given developer passed off their work to another developer. Secondly, the WFD score for a given code segment is calculated as the maximum degree centrality (from the developer to developer network) for any of the developers who worked on that specific code segment.

WFD can be described in more general terms by replacing code segment with task. Thus, WFD is defined as the maximum degree centrality (in the interpersonal network) of any team member who worked on the given task. The idea of WFD has important implications to various areas of work and is certainly not specific to software development. WFD is maximized for a given task when that task was assigned to someone with maximal degree centrality in the inter-person network. WFD is minimized when all team members assigned to a given task have no connections to other team members in the interpersonal network. 

WFD, as defined here, has the drawback that it is not very usable in comparing values between different team tasks. This is because the number of members on the team will have a significant impact on the reported value, but  there is no clear way to standardize this value. Additionally, WFD requires significant knowledge about how often members of the team must work together, and who has worked on any given task. This makes WFD difficult to use in many situations. On the other hand, WFD provides a powerful method to measure interdependency in the work flow of team tasks. 

#### Coordination Work Dependency
Coordination Work Dependency (CWD) is closely related to WFD. Where WFD is an index of the formal pass-offs required to submit code, CWD incorporates informal coordination requirements that are present in any team tasks. In a development team, if one developer needs to use specific functionality, they will likely need to informally consult with the developer in charge of that functionality. CWD is a way of leveraging knowledge about how tasks are related to understand dependency within the team.

CWD uses a different method to construct the interpersonal dependency network; however CWD and WFD are mathematically equivalent. In WFD, the person-to-person network is built out of how many formal interactions team-members have; the person-to-person relationships in CWD are built based on the amount that tasks assigned to individuals relate to each other.

The limitations and advantages to CWD are similar to those of WFD. The main differentiating point is that CWD will be built off of assessment of informal task relatedness, whereas WFD will be built off of formalized inter-person work flow relationships. They may have drastically different implications to outcomes, so there is merit in calculating both indices.

#### Clustering of Logical Dependency
When writing code, some files tend to be adjusted together. Likewise, a team may have some tasks which are typically performed together without any specific rule that says the two tasks should be related. These relationships have been called Logical dependencies in software development. The original concept is that code files that are changes simultaneously typically are related in some why even if there is not necessarily a syntactic connection between the two files. As files can be considered a special form of task, I will describe the CLD in terms of tasks. Clustering of Logical Dependency (CLD) is an index of dependency that accounts for how often tasks dependent on a central task are themselves dependent on each other. A higher CLD score indicates that tasks are likely to form clusters of highly interdependent tasks.  

Theoretically, clustering of dependencies may impact performance of a team in various ways. For example consider a team that has a perfectly clustered pattern of dependency. The tasks assigned to this team can be split between groups of completely interdependent tasks. The capability of delineating interdependent task groups could enable a team to allocate the tasks such that people that work together well are assigned to related tasks. By contrast, in a team where tasks are not highly clustered, it may be difficult to strategically assign tasks in such a promising way. In this way it is possible that a high CLD could be associated with increased performance. 

On the other hand, clustering may actually amplify the effects of failures. Let us consider three tasks such that T2, and T3 are dependent and T1 and also dependent on each other. Failure, or some sort of problem for T1 would likely hurt the performance of T2 and T3. Given that T2 and T3 are interdependent, there may also be a second order impact of the initial failure, such that because T2 had diminished performance T3's performance as hurt by both decreased performance of T1 and T2. Similarly T2's overall performance would take an even greater hit because in addition to T1's initial failure, T3 could have lower performance. Thus greater levels of CLD could be associated with the amplification of impacts from changes in performance. 

CLD is calculated as the ratio of links between neighbors of a central task, to possible links between neighbors of the central task. CLD is maximized when every task that a task is related to are all related to each other. CLD is minimized when there are no inter-connections between the tasks a central task is dependent on. 

One thing that makes CLD particularly nice mathematically speaking is that is has a meaningful 0 value with a maximum value of 1. CLD provides a value that can be reasonably used to compare between differing teams. CLD provides a method for investigating the impact of unique facets of how teams and tasks can be interdependent. 

#### Number of Logical Dependencies 
Number of Logical Dependencies (NLD) is an index of the total number of logical dependencies a file has. This is identical in practice to SDC with the exception that logical dependencies are used as a reference instead of syntactic dependencies. NLD is applied to the same dependency relationships that CLD is, and is only different from CLD because it uses a different network characteristic (degree instead of clustering coefficient).
