A critical review of structural interdependence measures and indices


# critiques

## multi level

reciprocal is just taken as reciprocal. But there is no theory of aggregation or compilation. 

same with team level stuff

most task work flow stuff is assessed at the team level. It is not asssessed for an individual task and then compiled somehow into higher levels. 

## task flow thompson 

is the output 4 unique things or 1 product...if it's 1 product, how does it become combined?

Thompson's images are confounded...task flow but also how the task product is aggregated (4 vs. 1 arrow)

## wood

things that can change over time with respect to interdependence and products: (1) the set of acts / tasks required, (2) the arrangement of acts / tasks required, (3) the relationship between tasks and product/output. In situations with greater stochastics, the same workflow arrangement may not produce the same product. 

## cause interdependence

outcome interdependence is about the extent to which goals are at the team rather than individual level. That's a statement about goals, which is thought to cause interdependence. Not sure if it is appropriate to call "team goals" the same thing as the concept that is causes, which is interdependence.

## task vs job self reports

according to some, a job is an accumulation of tasks. so task interdependence and job interdpeendence should be different things.

Currently, they are classified as separate things. 

## task vs. person self reports

Kiggundu (1981): initiated = degree to which work flows from a partiulcar job to one or more other jobs

Granter and Parker (2009) = occursd when work flows from the focal employee to others

## use these theoretical indices in the field
## to what extent do the theoretical indices match the self reports?
## To what extent do the indices, if established in the way the authors describe, actually lead to the relationships they theorize about?



# Daniel's taxonomy

1) magnitude

Count the number of links. (arthur notion of continuous or amount)

2) Interreladenss or motif or theme or trope

categorize into a pattern (arthur notion of type)

3) sequentiality

how many different tasks will be influenced if a specific task fails?
To me, this is an outcome of task linkages

think propagation...if something is an indicator of the propagation of errors, is that an indicator of interdependence?


# Definitions of tasks and roles

Wong & Campion 1991

A task represents certain processes in which the worker, through his or her actions, transforms inputs into outputs meaningful to the goals of the job by using tools, equipment, or work aids. 

A job is an aggregation of tasks assigned to a worker. When the same set of tasks are performed by more than one worker, those workers are said to have the same job. 

Oeser and Frank 1964

A task is something that has to be done
Person: a human being who has no relationships to other human beings except for those laid down by the rules of his office, and no characteristics other than those prescribed for assigning him to the occupancy of a given position.

position: a location on an organization chart, a concept which medaites between persons and the tasks they, as a group, have to perform. In partiulcar, a position specifieds (a) the set of characteristics or abilities required of a person assigned to it so that he can carry out the tasks allocated to that position; (b) the ways in which he is required to interact with other persons in other positions carrying out their sections of the total set of tasks


Steiner 2007

task: not a specific pattern of behaviors but a specification of the goal to be achieved and the procedures for achieving it


Arthur et al. 2012

task work: team's effort to understand and perform the requirements of the job, tasks, and equipment to be used (in contrast to teamwork). 

Wood 1986

frameworks for the study of tasks. 

1. task qua task. Tasks are defined as a pattern of stimuli impinging on the individual. Tasks characteristics are "real world" dimensions which relate to the physical nature of either the stimuli or the stimulus material.

2. Task as behavior requirements. Tasks are defined in terms of the behavioral responses a person should emit in order to achieve some specified level of performance. This approach has included defintitions which focus on critical behaviors.

3. Task as behavior descriptpion. Tasks are described and grouped in terms of the kinds of behaviors that people exhibit when actually performing the task.

4. Task as ability requirements. Tasks are differntiated on the basis of the different skills that are required to perform them. 

They combine the first two. The first one is the best, but hard to operationalize.

With those two in mind...
all tasks contain three essential components: products, acts, and information cues. 

task description requires that the product of interest first be identified and then the inputs be required for that product to be described at increasing levels of specificity until the components being identified represent specific acts and the information cues that must be attended to and processed in the performance of these acts.
