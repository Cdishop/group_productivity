# Notes on posible dependency directions
My original idea was to go though and identify a genralized way at looking at dependency in terms of the state requaired for a task to be completed. 

After talking though it, we think that a paper that lists current measures of dependency and describes where they are used could be more useful. 

After taking the review of dependency indecies, we could move on to do quite a bit in that space. Nothing really exists there. A generalized definition and conseptualization of dependency could be powerful, but we probably need to lay the foundation with a revew article first.
