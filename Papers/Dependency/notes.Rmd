# Notes on posible dependency directions
My original idea was to go though and identify a generalized way at looking at dependency in terms of the state required for a task to be completed. 

After talking though it, we think that a paper that lists current measures of dependency and describes where they are used could be more useful. 

After taking the review of dependency indices, we could move on to do quite a bit in that space. Nothing really exists there. A generalized definition and conceptualization of dependency could be powerful, but we probably need to lay the foundation with a review article first.

On Thursday the 8the we talked more about it. The current direction is to really focus on forming a framework for distinguishing and evaluating different forms of dependency indices. We have a lot of work as far as literature review to know where this will go.
