# Introduction

Team members must depend on each other to collectively achieve a goal; likewise, an individual's ability to perform a task may depend on a previous task's completion. Interdependence has been used as a key defining factor of teams (Kozlowski & Ilgen, 2006), and for decades the importance of this notion of dependency has been referenced throughout organizational science, computer science, engineering, and history literature (rrr). As Kozlowski and Bell stated, "Recognition of the central importance of team workflow, and the task interdependence it entails, to team structure and process is a... key characteristic of the organizational perspective on work groups and teams," (Kozlowski & Bell, 2003 page 455). 

Further highlighting the importance of dependency in teams, Hollenbeck et al. provided the Three-Dimensional Team Scaling Model (3DTSM), a three-dimensional framework for describing teams. This model focuses largely on types of dependence within teams (Hollenbeck, Beersma, & Schouten, 2012). Two of three components, 'horizontal differentiation' and 'skill differentiation', are directly related to the concept of dependency, as Lee et al. (2015) illustrated by incorporating these dimensions into the Team Descriptive Index (TDI) as 'horizontal interdependency' and 'vertical interdependency'. 

 Despite its apparent ubiquitous importance to teams, team structure, and team outcomes, there is little agreement on how dependency should be measured, or even how to describe it. To put this point into perspective, consider the debate over interrater agreement that transpired over the last four decades. There are two primary indices used to measure interrater agreement, rwg and kappa. Since 1984 (rrr), researchers have poured over these two indices, writing numerous articles that altercate the merit of one over the other (RRR). By stark contrast, in the world of dependency, despite a huge amount of discussion of the importance of it, and the numerous indices of dependency, no work has come forth to explain dependency directly. Thereby, there is no existing taxonomy by which these indices can be analyzed in a clear, well-defined manner. 

Without a framework to define the similarities and differences between indices of dependence, it is unclear if the various papers that proport to study dependency are, in fact, studying the same construct at all. Continued dependency research in the absence of a formalized language is in danger of making incorrect generalizations and identifying inconsistencies where there are none.

A well-defined taxonomy of dependency measures will contribute to future team research in various ways. First,  a formal classification system will greatly facilitate future scientific communication about the concept of dependency. Clear articulation of what is being measured will allow for greater confidence in comparisons and replications of results. Second, the clarity afforded by an established taxonomy could also resolve seemingly contradictory results. For example, interdependence has recently been associated with both positive and negative measures of performance (rrr). It is possible that a formal taxonomy of dependency would allow researchers to discriminate which measures of dependence are positively associated with performance and which are negatively associated.  Third, a formalized taxonomy for dependence will promote theory generation. The newfound ability to identify specific types of dependence will enable researchers to consider its important impacts on team outcomes in finer detail and with more depth than our current organizational lexicon allows for. 

The goal of this paper is to provide a theoretically grounded framework that can be used by researchers' studying dependency in organizations. It is our hope that this distinction will provide greater unity to the discussion of organizational dependencies and incite further direct discussion of this important topic. We are confident that this taxonomy will substantially aid future research and help to transform academia's understanding of dependency and its impacts.
