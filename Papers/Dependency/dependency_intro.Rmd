Despite decades of research on the topics of teams, tasks, and jobs, organizational science has largely failed to provide guidance on how to quantify dependency or understand the impact of dependency on collective performance. This fact is particularly salient when the one considers that dependency or related topics are mentioned continuously in the literature. It is apparent that there is a large need for a review of dependency covering such topics as what is dependency, how can it be measured, and what are the predicted outcomes of dependency on performance.

Perhaps one reasons that dependency has not been investigated toughly in organizational science is that the definition of dependency can be somewhat ambiguous. A dependency is a relationship where the fulfilment of one's role or the completion of a task is contingent on something else. These dependency relationships could be role to role relationships, (a child is dependent on their parent), task to task (to open the door I must first turn the door nob), task to state (to read there must be enough light), or any number of other possibilities. Likewise, what the relationship actually represents is somewhat ambiguous. A dependency could be a pure contingent relationship (task 1 cannot be completed without task two being completed first), or it could be a faciliatory (inhibitory) relationship (if there is noise in the room hearing you will be difficult). Lastly the dependence relationship could be a concurrent dependency (the door knob must be currently turned to open the door) or a consecutive dependency (the door must have been unlocked for me to turn the door nob). Clearly there are many forms of dependency, which makes the study of dependency difficult. 

Another factor that may have traditionally impeded the thorough investigation of dependency is that some may consider it only tangentially related to organizational science. An organizational psychologist researcher may, simple not be interested in the impact that state to task dependency has on a worker's ability to perform a task because it is too far removed from the psychological processes. With the exception of person to person "interdependency" few of the forms of dependency mentioned above directly relate to psycho-social processes that make up the bulk of team's research. 

Despite the difficulty of conducting rigorous research in the area of dependency, it is immensely important. This fact is highlighted by many prominent researchers, particularly when considering team performance. References to dependency are found throughout the organizational literature....

This paper will review research related to dependency in organizational science literature as well as in other literatures including computer science and engineering. The paper then provides a taxonomy on how to describe dependency, and provides examples of who dependency can be measured. We concluded with suggestions on who this information can be used in future research to more fully account for the impact of dependency on collective performance.
