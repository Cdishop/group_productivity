# Introduction

Team members must depend on each other to collectively achieve a goal, likewise an individual's ability to perform a task may depend on a previous task's completion. Interdependence has been used as a key defining factor of teams (Kozlowski & Ilgen, 2006), and for decades the importance of this notion of dependency has been referenced throughout organizational science literature in addition to various other academic fields such as computer science, engineering, and history (rrr). As Kozlowski and Bell stated, "Recognition of the central importance of team workflow, and the task interdependence it entails, to team structure and process is a. key characteristic of the organizational perspective on work groups and teams" (Kozlowski & Bell, 2003). 

Further highlighting the importance of dependency in teams, Hollenbeck et al. provided the Three-Dimensional Team Scaling Model (3DTSM), a 3 dimensional framework for describing teams which focuses largely on types of dependence of teams (Hollenbeck, Beersma, & Schouten, 2012). Two of three components, "horizontal differentiation" and "skill differentiation," are directly related to the concept of dependency as Lee et al. (2015) illustrated by incorporated these dimensions into the Team Descriptive Index (TDI) as "horizontal interdependency" and "vertical interdependency". Two of three dimensions that Lee et al. and Hollenbeck et al. use to differentiate types of teams are directly related to the concept of dependency.

 Despite its apparent ubiquitous importance to teams, team structure, and team outcomes, there is little agreement on how dependency should be measured, or how even to describe it. To put this point in perspective, consider the debate that took place across the last two decades over an index for agreement. There are two primary indices used to measure inter-rater agreement (Rwg and Kappa). Researchers have poured over these two indices writing numerous articles that hash out the merit of one over the other (RRR). In the world of dependency, by stark contrast, despite a huge amount of discussion of the importance of dependency, and the numerous indices of dependency, no work has come forth to discuss this notion directly and there is no existing taxonomy where by these indices can be analyzed in a clear well-defined manor. 

Without a framework defining the similarities and differences between indices of dependence it is unclear if the various papers the proport to study dependency are in fact studying the same construct at all. It is very possible that the various indices of dependency now used in the literature are measuring different constructs. Continued research in the absence of a formalized language to describe what an index of dependency is measuring, is in danger of making incorrect generalizations, and identifying inconsistencies where there are none.

A well-defined taxonomy of dependency measures will contribute to future team research in various ways. A taxonomy of dependency measures will greatly facilitate future scientific communication about the concept of dependency. Research identifying potential effects associated with measures of dependency could use a taxonomy to clearly articulate what is being measured, allowing for greater confidence in comparisons and replications of results. The clarity afforded by a formal taxonomy could also resolve seemingly contradictory results. For example, currently interdependence has been associated with both positive and negative measures of performance. It is possible that a formal taxonomy of dependency would allow researchers to discriminate what measures of dependence are positively associated with performance and what measures are negatively associated with performance.  

A formal taxonomy for dependency measures has at least one other potential contribution it would make to research. A formalized taxonomy for dependence will promote theory generation. The ability to identify specific types of dependence, will enable researchers to consider dependency and its important impacts on team outcomes, in finer detail and with more depth than our current organizational lexicon will allow. 

The goal of this paper is to providing a theoretically grounded framework that can be used by researchers studding dependency in organizations to discriminate between measures of dependency. It is our hope that this will provide greater unity to the discussion of organizational dependencies, and possibly spur on further direct discussion of this important topic in the literature. We are confident that this taxonomy will substantially aid future research and help to transform our understanding of dependency and it's impacts.
