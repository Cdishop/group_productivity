title: Dependency Intro
---
For decades the notion of dependency has been referenced throughout organizational science literature. In addition, concepts related to dependency in other fields as diverse as computer science and history (rrr Citations). Despite its apparent ubiquitous importance, there is little or no agreement on how dependency should be measured, or how even to describe it.

At its core, dependency is a directional relationship describing what is required to do a task. Work done by a team does not happen in a vacuum. What gets done is determined largely by external influences which including situational, contextual, and social dependency factors. Whenever someone relies on another person to do their work, and whenever a task cannot be accomplished before another task, dependency is impacting performance. The study of dependency relationships is crucial to forming a deeper understanding of the processes that drive collective performance.

Researchers have made tremendous strides in dependency research. For example interdependency has been studied directly as a factor in various studies (rrr). These studies have had mixed outcomes including increased and decreased performance. In the world of computer science objective methods for computing dependency indices have been developed and have been linked with increased error rates (rrr citation). As another example, economists have also studied the concept of dependency and provide equations to calculate indices of market independence. 

Despite these, and many other significant empirical and theoretical advances, there remains no clear agreement on methods of measurement or language to discuss dependency. In the present article reviewing current measurement of dependency we identify general patterns in the measurement of dependency, and develop a theoretical framework by which dependency can be precisely described. We use this taxonomy to describe, compare, and evaluate measurements of dependence found in the literature. We concluded with suggestions of which measures of dependency may be most useful in various scenarios.
