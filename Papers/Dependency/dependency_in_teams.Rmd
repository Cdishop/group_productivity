#Dependency in Teams

Various researchers have expressed that interdependency is an essential and defining characteristic of teams and team structures. Neuman and Write (Neuman & Wright, 1999) emphasized the importance of interdependence to teams stating that "teams consist of two or more individuals that can be characterized by high task interdependence" (p. 377). In a separate definition of teams, Kozlowski and Ilgen's (2006) again illustrate the importance of interdependence:

A team can be defined as (a) two or more individuals3 who (b) socially interact (face-to-face or, increasingly, virtually); (c) possess one or more common goals; (d) are brought together to perform organizationally relevant tasks; (e) exhibit interdependencies with respect to workflow, goals, and outcomes; (f) have different roles and responsibilities; and (g) are together embedded in an encompassing organizational system, with boundaries and linkages to the broader system context and task environment (p. 79)

These definitions demonstrate that a team's tasks, workflow, goals and outcomes can all be impacted by dependency relationships. Additionally, the definitional requirement that team members interact and possess common goals is related to concept of interdependency, and shows other areas in team processes that may be impacted by dependency.

In support of the deffinitional requirement of dependency in teams, research has shown that dependency is a key factor in differentiating types of teams. Lee et al.'s Team Descriptive Index (TDI) illustrates the importance of interdependence in differentiating types of teams. Specifically two of the TDI's three components are horizontal and vertical interdependence (Lee et al., 2015). According to the theoretical foundation of the TDI, a team with very strong horizontal dependence may have highly specialized team members and therefore each team member must rely heavily on the other team members to do their own job properly. This is an example of what Newman may have described as task interdependence. A highly vertically dependent team, by contrast, may require very precise timing in performing some basic task, thus a pattern of strong centralized decision making and leadership is important. Individual performance in this type of teams is highly dependent on the centralized leadership. In both cases the amount and type of dependency are important factors defining the team makeup. This tool for categorizing teams, further demonstrates the wide disparity in types of dependency found in the literature.

It is clear that the concept of dependency is central to teams deffinitionally. It has been further proposed the dependency has important impacts on performance and efficiency. For example, Mathieu proposed a model for collective performance that provides theoretical insight into the processes by which dependency may impact team effectiveness (Mathieu, Tannenbaum, Donsbach, & Alliger, 2014). The mathematical model they present is essentially a compilational model of collective performance where each team members contribution essentially summed up. The model accounts for the fact that individual roles in a team may be highly dependent on other roles. For example, in a football team, the performance of a wide receiver who catches the ball is highly dependent on the quarter back who is throwing the ball; if the quarter back cannot throw the ball the wide receiver will never catch. On the other hand if the wide receiver is poor, the quarterback may still have options such as running the ball, thus the quarterback's performance is not as dependent on the wide receiver as the reverse. Mathieu's concept of "linked member performance" is a theoretical construct of how much each member of the team contributes to team performance when these interdependencies are taken into account, and the total team effectiveness is calculated as an aggregation of these 'linked member performance' values.

Empirical work has validated Mathieu's theoretical claim that dependency is tied to Performance. For example dependency and  and its various related sub-constructs (interdependence, coordination, cooperation, team work etc.) have been empirically linked to numerous individual and outcomes including: individual well-being (rrr), failure rates (rrr), reward effectiveness (Persall, 2010), the impact of role ambiguity (rrr Beauchamp, 2001), in addition to general performance (Wageman, 1995; Shiflett, 1972). The notion of dependency clearly has a centrally important role in teams and team processes.

The study of dependency relationships is crucial to forming a deeper understanding of the processes that drive and influence collective performance. The study of dependency, however, is hindered by the current lack of a common framework by which different measures of dependency can be distinguished. The studies referenced previously  use vastly different measure of dependency including analysis of task structures, self report data, and observation of team member interactions. Hindered by the current lack of a clear taxonomy for dependency measures it is unclear how the serious measurement of dependency relate to each other or how they relate to theoretical frameworks such as Mathieu's model of team effectiveness. It is crucial the organizational science develop a structure whereby these measurements may be clearly compared side by side. Development of a common taxonomy which can be used to describe measures of dependency would greatly enhance our ability to investigate the impacts of dependency on teams and team outcomes and enhance theory development.
