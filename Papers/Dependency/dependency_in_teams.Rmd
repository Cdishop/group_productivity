#Dependency in Teams

Various researchers have expressed that interdependency is an essential and defining characteristic of teams and team structures. Neuman and Wright (1999) emphasized the importance of interdependence to teams, stating that, "teams consist of two or more individuals that can be characterized by high task interdependence," (p. 377). In a separate definition of teams, Kozlowski and Ilgen's (2006) illustrate the importance of interdependence:

\textit{A team can be defined as (a) two or more individuals who (b) socially interact (face-to-face or, increasingly, virtually); (c) possess one or more common goals; (d) are brought together to perform organizationally relevant tasks; (e) exhibit interdependencies with respect to workflow, goals, and outcomes; (f) have different roles and responsibilities; and (g) are together embedded in an encompassing organizational system, with boundaries and linkages to the broader system context and task environment (p. 79)}

These definitions demonstrate that a team's tasks, workflow, goals and outcomes can all be impacted by dependency relationships. Additionally, the definitional requirement that team members interact and possess common goals is related to the concept of interdependency and shows other areas in team processes that may be impacted by dependency.

In support of the definitional requirement of dependency in teams, research has shown that dependency is a key factor in differentiating types of teams. Lee et al.'s Team Descriptive Index (TDI) illustrates the importance of interdependence in differentiating types of teams. Specifically, two of the TDI's three components are horizontal and vertical interdependence (Lee et al., 2015). According to the theoretical foundation of the TDI, a team with very strong horizontal dependence may have highly specialized team members, and therefore each team member must rely heavily on the other team members to do their own job properly. This is an example of what Newman described as task interdependence. A highly vertically dependent team, by contrast, may require very precise timing in performing some basic task, thus a pattern of strong, centralized decision-making and leadership is important. Individual performance in this type of team is highly dependent on its centralized leadership. In both cases, the amount and type of dependency are important factors in defining the team's composition. This tool for categorizing teams further demonstrates the wide disparity in types of dependency found in the literature.

The concept of dependency is central to teams definitionally. It has been further proposed that dependency has important impacts on performance and efficiency. For example, Mathieu proposed a model for collective performance that provides theoretical insight into the processes by which dependency may impact team effectiveness (Mathieu, Tannenbaum, Donsbach, & Alliger, 2014). The mathematical model they present is a compilational model of collective performance where each team member's contribution is  summed up. The model accounts for the fact that individual roles in a team may be highly dependent on other roles. For example, in a football team, the performance of a wide receiver who catches the ball is highly dependent on the quarterback who is throwing the ball; if the quarterback cannot throw the ball, the wide receiver will never catch. On the other hand, if the wide receiver is poor, the quarterback may still have options such as running the ball, thus the quarterback's performance is not as dependent on the wide receiver as the reverse. Mathieu's concept of 'linked member performance' is a theoretical construct of how much each member of the team contributes to team performance when these interdependencies are considered, and the total team effectiveness is calculated as an aggregation of these 'linked member performance' values.

Empirical work has validated Mathieu's theoretical claim that dependency is tied to performance. For example, dependency and its related sub-constructs (interdependence, coordination, cooperation, team work, etc.) have been empirically linked to numerous individual and outcomes, including: individual well-being (rrr), failure rates (rrr), reward effectiveness (Persall, 2010), the impact of role ambiguity (rrr Beauchamp, 2001), and general performance (Wageman, 1995; Shiflett, 1972). The notion of dependency clearly has a centrally important role in teams and team processes.

The study of dependency relationships is crucial to forming a deeper understanding of the processes that drive and influence collective performance. The study of dependency, however, is hindered by the current lack of a common framework by which different measures of dependency can be distinguished. The studies referenced previously use vastly different measures of dependency, including analysis of task structures, self-reported data, and observations of team member interaction. Without a clear taxonomy for dependency measures, it is unclear how measurements of dependency relate to each other or to theoretical frameworks such as Mathieu's model of team effectiveness. It is crucial that organizational science develop a structure whereby these measurements may be clearly compared side by side. Development of such a typology would elucidate investigations into the impact of dependency on teams and team outcomes, as well as enhancing theory development.
