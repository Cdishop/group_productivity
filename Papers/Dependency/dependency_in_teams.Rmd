#Dependency in Teams

At its core, a dependency is a relationship describing what is required to enable a task to be accomplished or for what factors influence an individual's ability to do their job. Work done by a team does not happen in a vacuum; what gets done is determined largely by external influences which include situational, contextual, and social dependency factors. Whenever someone relies on another person to do their work, and whenever a task cannot be accomplished before another task, dependency is impacting work and performance. 

Various researchers have expressed that interdependency is an essential and defining characteristic of teams and team structures. Neuman and Write (Neuman & Wright, 1999) emphasized the importance of interdependence to teams stating that "teams consist of two or more individuals that can be characterized by high task interdependence" (p. 377). In a separate definition of teams, Kozlowski and Ilgen's (2006) again illustrate the importance of interdependence:

A team can be defined as (a) two or more individuals3 who (b) socially interact (face-to-face or, increasingly, virtually); (c) possess one or more common goals; (d) are brought together to perform organizationally relevant tasks; (e) exhibit interdependencies with respect to workflow, goals, and outcomes; (f) have different roles and responsibilities; and (g) are together embedded in an encompassing organizational system, with boundaries and linkages to the broader system context and task environment (p. 79)

These definitions demonstrate that a team's tasks, workflow, goals and outcomes can all be impacted by dependency relationships. Additionally, the definitional requirement that team members interact and possess common goals is related to concept of interdependency, and shows other areas in team processes that may be impacted by dependency.

Not only is the presence of some form of dependency a definitional requirement of teams, research has shown that dependency is a key factor in differentiating types of teams. Lee et al.'s Team Descriptive Index (TDI) illustrates the importance of interdependence in differentiating types of teams. Specifically two of the TDI's three components are horizontal and vertical interdependence (Lee et al., 2015), indicating that the type and amount of interdependency found in a team is highly discriminant of differing types of teams. 

According to the theoretical foundation of the TDI, a team with very strong horizontal dependence may have highly specialized team members and therefore each team member must rely heavily on the other team members to do their own job properly. This is an example of what Newman may have described as task interdependence. A highly vertically dependent team, by contrast, may require very precise timing in performing some basic task, thus a pattern of strong centralized decision making and leadership is important. Individual performance in this type of teams is highly dependent on the centralized leadership. In both cases the amount and type of dependency are important factors defining the team makeup. This tool for categorizing teams, further demonstrates the wide disparity in types of dependency found in the literature.

Mathieu has also given insight into the importance of dependency in team performance. Mathieu proposed a model for collective performance that provides theoretical insight into how dependency may impact team effectiveness (Mathieu, Tannenbaum, Donsbach, & Alliger, 2014). The mathematical model is essentially a compilational model of collective performance where each team members contribution essentially summed up, but this model accounts for the fact that individual roles in a team may be highly dependent on other roles. For example, in a football team, the performance of a wide receiver who catches the ball is highly dependent on the quarter back who is throwing the ball; if the quarter back cannot throw the ball the wide receiver will never catch. On the other hand if the wide receiver is poor, the quarterback may still have options such as running the ball, thus the quarterback's performance is not as dependent on the wide receiver as the reverse. Mathieu's concept of "linked member performance" is a theoretical measure of how much each member of the team contributes to team performance when these interdependencies are taken into account, and the total team effectiveness is calculated as an aggregation of these 'linked member performance' measures.

The study of dependency relationships is crucial to forming a deeper understanding of the processes that drive collective performance. The study of dependency, however, is hindered by the current lack of a common framework by which different measures of dependency can be distinguished. Development of a common taxonomy which can be used to describe measures of dependency would greatly enhance our ability to both investigate the impacts of dependency on teams and team outcomes. It should be noted that when discussing the concept of dependency organizational researchers often uses the term interdependency. While there may be some informative reasons to differentiate between interdependency and dependency, in this paper we are mainly interested in considering general patterns that apply to either concept. We will not make any finer distinction between the terms dependency and interdependency.
