ARE WE COUCHING OURSELVES IN PASSIVE MEASURES? WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MANIPULATIONS?



The nature of work is changing such that the connections between actors are increasingly relevant levers for understanding and benefiting from human capital. Five times as many Americans are employed in service jobs compared to those in manufacturing and production [@ford_service-dominant_2008; @parker_future_2001], signaling the shift from a manufacturing economy of additive tasks to a market economy of knowledge and service in which organizational success is driven by the complex interplay between customers, employees, and stakeholders. Changes in information, communication, and transportation technology fueled flatter firm hierarchies, virtual and telework, and teams as the building blocks of modern organizations [@mathieu_review_2014] where employees must manage work flows and coordinate their activities to perform at high levels [@kozlowski_groups_2012]. Organizational scientists now emphasize questions about connections and interdependence among employees who collaborate with and receive feedback from their coworkers [@grant_7_2009] because the interplay of task and social relations among team members is thought to either relate to outcomes such as collective efficacy, cohesion, behavioral processes, and performance [@courtright_structural_2015] or create the context in which team behaviors unfold through time [@marks_temporally_2001; @baard_performance_2014]. Understanding the nature of dependence among actors will enable organizations to better design, train, develop, and motivate personnel for effective teamwork, whereas endeavors that fail to consider interdependence have "little relevance to building knowledge in the work groups and team literatures" [kozlowski2003work, p. 363].

Interdependence or dependency (defined later) has received increasing attention among organizational researchers, and most tie their work in some way to the notions of Thompson's (1967) task workflows, Mohr's (1971) writing on the extent to which individuals perceive that they have "one person" jobs, or Penning's (1975) bases of interconnectedness. Bell and Kozlowski [-@bell_typology_2002] present a typology of virtual teams where interdependency is one of the main features distinguishing different team types; @morgeson2012work and @grant_7_2009 review the work design literature and present task interdependence as a key feature for understanding organizational behavior; @kiggundu_task_1981 presents a theory of how interdependence relates to feelings of responsibility to one's work; @lenox_interdependency_2007 use interdependence in their theory on why firms rise and fall within an industry over time; and @puranam_organization_2012 theorize about the relationships between organization design, information processing, and interdependence. Empirical studies on interdependence, both as a predictor and outcome, slowed after initial reports by @ven_determinants_1976 and @cheng_interdependence_1983 but have recently reemerged in the literature [e.g., @de_dreu_cooperative_2007; @grant_significance_2008; @hertel_managing_2004].  

Although these reviews, theories, meta analyses, and empirical studies have increased our understanding of interdependence and its role in organizational behavior, its measurement and operationalization have yet to be unified or organized. Items sometimes measure interdependence without attending to (and perhaps confounding) its various directions, such as initiated and received (kugg) or reciprocal (cite). There are different domains that it can apply to, such as role, task, or outcome dependence (cite), different levels of abstraction, such as whether the measure applies to the individual, dyad, group, or firm (cite), and has been proposed as a way to create typologies both for teams and tasks (hollenbeck). Conceptually, many of these issues have been refined, especially within a recent meta analysis by Courtright et al., 2015, but the literature contains little guidance on how different measures of interdependence appropriately or innappropriately tap the different aspects mentioned above. Moreover, there are theoretical indices, observational measures, self reports, discrete task counts, workflow images used in supervisor interviews, formal equations for agent-based models, network indices, and algorithms for computing dependence based on resource exchanges all as methods of indicating the level of interdependence in a given setting. The purpose of this paper is to organize this material, provide a taxonomy of interdependence measures, and link measures to specific purposes so that future research can appropriately align measurement with theory. 

# Structural Interdependence

Interdependence has been discussed across many reviews in fields ranging from organizational psychology to political science, strategy, and management (cites). Theoretical clarity on its different forms was provided in a meta analysis by Courtright et al. (2015), we follow their organization to introduce this material. Structural interdependence refers to features of the team -- such as resources and workflows as well as goal and reward systems that can be deliberately manipulated by team leaders and members -- that define the interconnectedness of team members (Wageman, 1999). Courtright et al. (2015) note that,

>> team members and leaders choose low [structural] interdependence when they structure tasks on an individual basis with a pooled product, when they form the team with resources redundant across team members, or when they establish goal and reward systems that primarily emphasize individual contributions over collective outputs. In contrast, they choose high [structural] interdependence when members simultaneously work on all aspects of the task, when they intentionally form groups with members processing varied access to resources, or when they establish goal and reward systems that primarily emphasize collective outputs. (p. 3). 

Structural interdependence is distinct from teamwork behaviors such as planning, monitoring progress, confidence building, and 
backup behaviors (marks matheiu), which are referred to collectively as behavioral processes in the teams literature (DeChurch & Mesmer-Magnus, 2010). Shea and Guzzo (1987) and Wageman (1999) referred to actual team behaviors and interactions as an alternative form of interdependence, called behavioral interdependence, meaning, for example, if workers on an assembly line "A" interact more than workers on assembly line "B" then those in "A" have greater behavioral interdependence. But Courtright et al. (2015) note that this idea is largely captured within the behavioral processes outlined in the groups and teams literature. Our paper focuses on measures and theoretical indices for structural interdependence. 

# Forms of Structural Interdependence - Task and Outcome

Different labels exist for the various dimensions of structural interdependence, but they can largely be classified within two areas: task and outcome interdependence. Task interdependence refers to "the degree to which taskwork is designed so that members depend upon one another for access to resources and create workflows that require coordinated action" (Courtright et al., 2015, p. 4). It captures what Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, and Gilson (2008) called means interdependence, what Van de Ven and Ferry (1980) and Thompson (1967) called task interdependence or the notion of workflow patterns, what Aurther Jr. et al. (2012) called team relatedness and workflow, O'Brien's (1968) notions of collaboration and coordination, and the dimensions of role theory outlined by Oeser and Harary (1962). Research in this area focuses on how tasks are divided among the group, the precedence relationships among tasks and roles, the extent to which members depend on one another for skills, data, materials, information, and other resources, the combination of task accomplishments into a final product, the exent to which members work individually versus in a group, and the flow of materials across members. 

Outcome interdependence refers to "the degree to which the outcomes of taskwork are measured, rewarded, and communicated at the group level so as to emphasize collective outputs rather than individual contributions" (Courtright et al., 2015, p. 4). It captures what Puranam, Reveendran, and Knudsen (2012) called agent interdependence, what Barrick et al. (2007) called psychological interdependence, what Pennings (1974) called social interconnectedness, what Tosvold (1986) called goal interdependence, and the notions of payoff differences with respect to what Victor and Blackburn (1987) called reflexive, fate, and behavioral control. Research in this area focuses on whether goals and feedback are provided at the individual versus team level, the nature of feedback and rewards and whether they are contingent on individual or group contributions, and how performance is aggregated, measured, and communicated.

# Interdependence or Dependency

interdependence can come from several sources...it can be enforced or caused by many things: task, process of exectuing work, goals, rewards/incentives (wageman, 1995). 

### Task interdependence
van de ven, Belbecq, Koenig 1976 - task interdependence (based on thompson and Mohr)
extent to which unit personnel are dependent upon one another to perform their individual jobs

cheng 1983 - interdependence (based on thompson and Mohr)
extent to which the organization's task requires its members to work with one another

wageman, 1995 - task interdependence
means by which work is accomplished. 
degree to which the task requires collective action

(a) characteristic of the work

thompson: assembly line work is inherently sequential

(b) characteristic of the way people behave

Shea & Guzzo (1989) assembly line workers who help each other are more task interdependent than those who do not. 


Morgeson, Garza, & Campion (2012) - interdependence
degree to which job depends on others and others depend on it to complete the work
reflects the structural "connectedness"
extent to which a job has tasks that flow from other jobs
morgeson & humphrey 2006 differentiate initiated vs. received
the job requires me to accomplish my stuff first vs.  my job activities require others...

hertel, konradt, & orlikowski, 2004 - task interdependence
when high, team members work closely together, must coordinate activities frequently, and within which the way one member accomplishes his or her task has strong impliciations on the work processes of other team members. 
group members work closely with each other in doing their work
GROUP LEVEL MEASURE

Pearce & Gregersen, 1991 - task interdependence
doesn't define task interdependence (notionally similar to Thompson and Kiggundu)
first 5 itemes = reciprocal interdependence at individual level
3 items = independence

Liden, Wayne, & Bradway, 1997
task interdependence: degree to which completing tasks requires the interaction of group members (Shea & Guzzo, 1987). 
Group level measure

Hirst 1988 - task interdependence (couched in Thompson 1967)
connectedness of tasks. Varies in complexity from pooled to reciprocal. 

Wong & Campion 1991

A task represents certain processes in which the worker, through his or her actions, transforms inputs into outputs meaningful to the goals of the job by using tools, equipment, or work aids. 

A job is an aggregation of tasks assigned to a worker. When the same set of tasks are performed by  more than one worker, those workers are said to have the same job.

task interdependence
extent to which the inputs, processes, or outputs of the task affect or depend on the inputs, processes, or outputs of other tasks within the same job. 





couching ourselves in task dependency. Not outcome dependency

Also couching ourselves in that we are focused on dependency in teams
