# Daniel's taxonomy:

Axis 1: level of analysis

individual 
team

Axis 2: structure

magnitude
inter-relatedness
sequences


## Flesh that out further

(a) Axis 1

individual - measures that apply only to a single measure (person, role, or task)
team - measures that apply to the entire team at once


Aggregation is its own discussion


(b) Axis 2

### magnitude

based on count, size, or strength of dependence relationships, without regard to the distribution of connections or their location.

1) count of connections. How many nodes does John connect to? In-degree = received interdependence. Out-degree = initiated interdependence

2) size of connections. Not sure

3) strength of connections. How strong is the tie between John and the other node? How many connections are there in the network compared to the total possible number of connections?

### interrelatedness

not sure

### Sequentiality
