# network indices


(a) density

how connected is the group compared to what it could be?
ratio of connections present to total possible network connections

(b) degree

number of connections a given node has

(c) transitivity

perfect transitivity means that if X is connected to Y and Y is connected to Z, then X is connected to Z as well. It implies groups or clustering.

(d) path length

average number of steps between two nodes across the entire network. Measures easiness of information transport.

### 2 task interdependence

Van de Ven, Delbecq, and Koenig, 1976

(a) Thompson's 1967 workflow

Indicate what percent of the total work within your unit flows in each of the ways shown by this figure...

(1) independent work flow

where work and activities are performed by your immediate subordinates independently and do not flow between them (give percent)

(2) sequential work flow

where work and activities flow between your immediate subordinates, but only in one direction (give percent)

(3) reciprocal work flow

where work and activities flow between your immediate subordinates in a reciprocal "back and forth" manner over a period of time.

(4) team work flow

where work and activities come into your unit and your immediate subordinates diagnose, problem-solve, and collaborate as a group at the same time to deal with the work.

stability - team has been together for a long time vs not
authority differentiation - one formal leader vs. no real leader
skill differentiation - team members have unique skills and contacts vs. even untrained people could perform almost all of the tasks




# Theoretical indices


What do the indices represent?
task interdependence
- given a task network, to what extent are people working the same tasks? (collaboration)
++ if you wanted to make it individual, just count the number of people working on a single task
- given a task network, to what extent are there precedence relationships? (coordination (could be team or individual level))
outcome interdependence
- what are the rewards given task choices by agents? (number within matrix)
- extent to which the rewards/outcomes/payoff of my task choices are determined or influenced by other's task choices (ID index)
- are the rewards for my individual task choices coordinated with the rewards for the other player's task choices? (ID index)

nk model
scaling notion (think baby weight and medicine). 
Number of tasks that this focal task depends on (one dimension) and possible effects that can have on performance (the other dimension). 
When the focal task depends on only one other task, then there are 4 possible "task arrangements" that result in different performance values. Increase the number of tasks that the focal task depends on, so we increased dimension 1 by one unit, but the other dimension goes up exponentially. There are now many many more potentially different performance values. 
Now an index, but a way to formally express the increasing complexity of the effects task arrangements can have on performance as the tasks start to depend on one another. 






### 1 collaboration and coordination

O'Brien 1968

(a) collaboration

extent to which two or more people operate on the same task
extent of joint responsibility (tug of war has very high collaboration)

Index: sum of entries in the task allocation matrix
- independent tasks = 0
- 2 people and 2 tasks. 1 person works on task A, both people work together on task B = 0.5
- everybody works on every task = 1

Not workflow, but combining effort simultaneously

(b) coordination

extent to which you need sequencing, where one thing must be completed to get to the next
extent to which subtasks need to be sequenced or depend on one another
index of definite precedence relationships
in the entire network of tasks, the extent to which tasks require other tasks either from other people or other time points

for a given individual, how many subtasks do they require? Sum that notion across all individuals. 

lower when people do not need prior tasks
greater when people require prior tasks before completing their own

team A and team B have the same number of people and the same number of tasks and the same number of required subtasks for each task. In team A, John completes his own subtasks, whereas in team B, all members require subtasks from other members. In team B, the coordination index will be slightly higher. 

look at images A and B. In both networks, there are 3 subtasks that need to be complete (t4 requires t3, t3 requires t2, and t2 requires t1). In a, there is a straight transfer from person 1 to person 2, whereas in b there are two switches: John requires a subtask from Jamal, and Jamal then needs a subtask from John. When that switching happens, the index increases slighty. 








### 2 outcome interdependence

Victor and Blackburn 1987

Theory of interdependence using notions of fate, behavior, and reflexive control. They use that terminology, but their concepts can be understood using game theory matrix set ups and the idea of outcome interdependence: how do rewards get allocated?

Interunit dependence is defined as the extent to wihch a node's outcomes are controlled directly by or are contingent upon the actions of another node. 

(a) reflexive control

Susie has reflexive control when changing from one action to another, within the same action row of the other player, changes her payoff. In other words, given a strategy by Mark, when Susie changes from one action to another, her payoff changes. 

when players have reflexive control, their individual actions influence their own performance. 

a matrix where both players have reflexive control corresponds to a pooled workflow in the lingo of Thompson. 

(b) fate control

I'm Victor, and the other player is Jill. Jill has fate control over me, Victor, when her choosing a strategy always results in a better (or worse) outcome for me. I choose either handshake or high-five, she chooses either smile at me or frown and ignore me. When I choose handshake, my payoff or outcome is greater when she chooses to smile at me. When I choose high-five, my payoff or outcome is greater when she chooses to smile at me. In both cases, my payoff was greater through one of her actions, she had some control over the events. That's the notion of fate control.

Adding fate control to the matrix, along with reflexive corresponds to the sequential interdependence notion from Thompson

When reflexive actions correspond with fate control actions = correspondent
When reflexive actions differ from fate control actions = non correspondent 

ID index going from 0 to -1 = increasingly non correspondent. 
ID index going from 0 to 1 = increasingly correspondent.

As the amount of fate and behavioral control increase relative to refelxive control (as the amount of my outcomes are increasingly under the influence of the other player's actions) the index approaches 1. 

(c) behavior control

My outcomes are contingent upon, but not completely determined by, the other player's actions. 

when you add behavior control to the matrix, you get reciprocal interdependent in the lingo of thompson








### 3 structural role theory

Oeser and Frank 1962
Oeser and Frank 1964
Oeser and O'Brien 1967

(a) foundations in the 1962 paper

A way of specifying tasks, positions, and roles with graphs and matrices. A formal model of task allocations, roles, and task precedence relationships for the purpose of representing group structure, how individual tasks relate to the entire system of task elements in a team, logically describing group processes over time as a set of relations among task elements, and a classification system for comparative analysis. 

(b) task by person matrix in the 1964 paper

equivalent to O'Brien's collaboration index, but from the perspective of time allocation per person rather than number of people on a given task.

I spend 30% of my time on task A, whereas Rachel spends 90% of her time on task A. We work together simultaneously, but she allocates more time to that task (in relation to all of her other tasks) than I do (in relation to all of my other tasks). 

Implications
- if two people share the same task, informal relationships will develop (potential for positive or negative)
- to the extent that they allocate different amounts of time, the relationship will be perceived as unfair

(c) task by task matrix in the 1967 paper

equivalent to O'Brien's inter coordination index, to what extent are there task precedence relationships?

t1 => t2 => t3 => t4 (situation 1)

situation 2
t1 => t4
t2 => t4
t3 => t4

situation 1 demands greater inter coordination


They also have an index for representing different routes to completion. In many cases, different task routes can be used to complete the same objective.









### 4 NK model of interdependence


For any industry, there exists an optimal arrangement of activities. They provide examples of activies such as adopting just-in-time logistics, forgoing piece rate payments, uses quality sampling, encourages integrated work teams, and refuses to offer stock options. They view the activities as all possible strategic organization decisions, but they could also be tasks or precedence relationships. 

[011] = don't use weekly meetings, use teams, use team-based goals. Each of these has a corresponding performance value: not using weekly meetings might have a value of 0.3 whereas using weekly meetings has a performance value of 0.9.

They define an optimal arrangement of activities for a given industry...to what extent does the organziation's arrangement of activities match the environment-defined optimal? Those firms do better and survive. 

No problem when the activities are independent. But when they are dependent, "use weekly meetings" may not provide 0.9, it depends on whether the other activities are active or not active. 

Let's say "use weekly meetings" (A) depends on "using teams" (B). Then we have vector [A, B], with corresponding orientations of activations [0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]. Each orientation might provide A with a different performance value. In other words, its contribution to performance depends on the state of the activities it depends on. 

Now let's say "use weekly meetings" depends not only on B, also on activity C. Now we have the vector [A, B, C] with corresponding orientations of activations [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1]...etc. and each gets a potentially different performance value. 

This index of interdependence is a way of describing contributions to performance.

Not a way of characterizing the nature of workflow with respect to a system of tasks, but a way of characterizing the complexity of task interactions as the number of tasks or activities increases and the number of different results an activity/task can have on performance -- or any other outcome -- given the nature of the tasks it depends on. 

















# Other measures / things we are not talking about 

Task reflexivity (De Dreu, 2007)
- The team often reviews its objectives
- The mtehods used by the team to get the job done are often discussed
- We regularly discuss whether the team is working effectively together
- In this team, we modify our objectives in light of changing circumstances

Information sharing (De Dreu, 2007)
- Communicating is a problem in my team
- Members of my team inform each other about work-related issues
- The quality of information exchange in our team is good
- I get new facts, insights, and ideas from my colleagues
- During work meetings we tell each other what we knew already and do ourselves during team meetings
- We do not repeate ourselves during team meetings

Learning from one another (De Dreu, 2007)
- Team members learn a lot from each other
- My team learns from mistakes and errors
- Team members ask and give each other feedback


task uncertainty (Van de ven)

steepness or hierarchy amount (Carpenter, 1971)

org structure (dalton, todor, spendolini, fielding, porter, 1980)
- size 
- span of control
- flat/tall hierarchy
- administrative intensity
- specialization
- formalization
- centralization


Things that cause managers to perceive dependence (Mccan and Ferry 1981): resources passed between units, amount of resources exchanged per unit of time, frequency of transactions per unit of time. How those lead to disagreements, and how those disagreements produce conflict. 


relatedness among firms (Fan & Lang, 2000) - can one firms products serve as anothers resources? Do they share any of the market?

statistical Models of interdependence, such as the actor partner model of dyadic relationships (cook & kenny, 2005). 

communication/cooperation between work groups (campion, someone, higgs 1993)
- I frequently talk to other people in the company besides the people on my team
- There is little competition between my team and other teams in the company
- Teams in the company cooperate to get the work done

workload sharing (campion, someone, higgs, 1993)
- everyone on my team does their fair share of the work
- no one in my team depends on other team members to do the work for them
- nearly all the members on my team contribute equally to the work



Roby & Lanzetta 1958
- a way of describing the different properties of a task (but not the patterned workflow among different tasks)
- they do provide a person by person communication exchange matrix and a person by task allocation matrix, but there is no index given.
- also established as a way to classify laboratory tasks, not real-world tasks



Morrissette, Pearson, and Switzer 1965
- entropy as a measure of task difficulty
