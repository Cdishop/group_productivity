### 1 positive outcome interdependence

Janssen, Vliert, and Veenstra, 1999
Characteristic for our team was that (a) goal attainment for one team member facilitated goal attainment for others; (b) success for one team member implied success for others; (c) benefits for one team member involved benefits for others; and (d) gain for one team member meant gain for others

### 2 task interdependence

Van de Ven, Delbecq, and Koenig, 1976

(a) Thompson's 1967 workflow

Indicate what percent of the total work within your unit flows in each of the ways shown by this figure...

(1) independent work flow

where work and activities are performed by your immediate subordinates independently and do not flow between them (give percent)

(2) sequential work flow

where work and activities flow between your immediate subordinates, but only in one direction (give percent)

(3) reciprocal work flow

where work and activities flow between your immediate subordinates in a reciprocal "back and forth" manner over a period of time.

(4) team work flow

where work and activities come into your unit and your immediate subordinates diagnose, problem-solve, and collaborate as a group at the same time to deal with the work.

(b) Mohr's 1971 task interdependence

- to what extent do people in this unit have one-person jobs: that is, in order to get the work out to what extent do unit members independently accomplish their own assigned tasks?

- to waht extent do all the unit members meet together to discuss how each task, case, or claim should be performed or treated in order to do the work in this unit?

# TDI - don't think we should use

stability - team has been together for a long time vs not
authority differentiation - one formal leader vs. no real leader
skill differentiation - team members have unique skills and contacts vs. even untrained people could perform almost all of the tasks


# Theoretical indices

### 1 collaboration and coordination

O'Brien 1968

(a) collaboration

extent to which two or more people operate on the same task
extent of joint responsibility (tug of war has very high collaboration)

Index: sum of entries in the task allocation matrix
- independent tasks = 0
- 2 people and 2 tasks. 1 person works on task A, both people work together on task B = 0.5
- everybody works on every task = 1

Not workflow, but combining effort simultaneously

(b) coordination

extent to which you need sequencing, where one thing must be completed to get to the next
extent to which subtasks need to be sequenced or depend on one another
index of definite precedence relationships
in the entire network of tasks, the extent to which tasks require other tasks either from other people or other time points

for a given individual, how many subtasks do they require? Sum that notion across all individuals. 

lower when people do not need prior tasks
greater when people require prior tasks before completing their own

team A and team B have the same number of people and the same number of tasks and the same number of required subtasks for each task. In team A, John completes his own subtasks, whereas in team B, all members require subtasks from other members. In team B, the coordination index will be slightly higher. 

look at images A and B. In both networks, there are 3 subtasks that need to be complete (t4 requires t3, t3 requires t2, and t2 requires t1). In a, there is a straight transfer from person 1 to person 2, whereas in b there are two switches: John requires a subtask from Jamal, and Jamal then needs a subtask from John. When that switching happens, the index increases slighty. 


### 2 outcome interdependence

Victor and Blackburn 1987

Theory of interdependence using notions of fate, behavior, and reflexive control. They use that terminology, but their concepts can be understood using game theory matrix set ups and the idea of outcome interdependence: how do rewards get allocated?

Interunit dependence is defined as the extent to wihch a node's outcomes are controlled directly by or are contingent upon the actions of another node. 

(a) reflexive control

Susie has reflexive control when changing from one action to another, within the same action row of the other player, changes her payoff. In other words, given a strategy by Mark, when Susie changes from one action to another, her payoff changes. 

when players have reflexive control, their individual actions influence their own performance. 

a matrix where both players have reflexive control corresponds to a pooled workflow in the lingo of Thompson. 

(b) fate control

I'm Victor, and the other player is Jill. Jill has fate control over me, Victor, when her choosing a strategy always results in a better (or worse) outcome for me. I choose either handshake or high-five, she chooses either smile at me or frown and ignore me. When I choose handshake, my payoff or outcome is greater when she chooses to smile at me. When I choose high-five, my payoff or outcome is greater when she chooses to smile at me. In both cases, my payoff was greater through one of her actions, she had some control over the events. That's the notion of fate control.

Adding fate control to the matrix, along with reflexive corresponds to the sequential interdependence notion from Thompson

When reflexive actions correspond with fate control actions = correspondent
When reflexive actions differ from fate control actions = non correspondent 

ID index going from 0 to -1 = increasingly non correspondent. 
ID index going from 0 to 1 = increasingly correspondent.

As the amount of fate and behavioral control increase relative to refelxive control (as the amount of my outcomes are increasingly under the influence of the other player's actions) the index approaches 1. 

(c) behavior control

My outcomes are contingent upon, but not completely determined by, the other player's actions. 

when you add behavior control to the matrix, you get reciprocal interdependent in the lingo of thompson

# Other measures / things we are not talking about 

Task reflexivity (De Dreu, 2007)
- The team often reviews its objectives
- The mtehods used by the team to get the job done are often discussed
- We regularly discuss whether the team is working effectively together
- In this team, we modify our objectives in light of changing circumstances

Information sharing (De Dreu, 2007)
- Communicating is a problem in my team
- Members of my team inform each other about work-related issues
- The quality of information exchange in our team is good
- I get new facts, insights, and ideas from my colleagues
- During work meetings we tell each other what we knew already and do ourselves during team meetings
- We do not repeate ourselves during team meetings

Learning from one another (De Dreu, 2007)
- Team members learn a lot from each other
- My team learns from mistakes and errors
- Team members ask and give each other feedback


task uncertainty (Van de ven)

steepness or hierarchy amount (Carpenter, 1971)

org structure (dalton, todor, spendolini, fielding, porter, 1980)
- size 
- span of control
- flat/tall hierarchy
- administrative intensity
- specialization
- formalization
- centralization


Things that cause managers to perceive dependence (Mccan and Ferry 1981): resources passed between units, amount of resources exchanged per unit of time, frequency of transactions per unit of time. How those lead to disagreements, and how those disagreements produce conflict. 


relatedness among firms (Fan & Lang, 2000) - can one firms products serve as anothers resources? Do they share any of the market?

statistical Models of interdependence, such as the actor partner model of dyadic relationships (cook & kenny, 2005). 

communication/cooperation between work groups (campion, someone, higgs 1993)
- I frequently talk to other people in the company besides the people on my team
- There is little competition between my team and other teams in the company
- Teams in the company cooperate to get the work done

workload sharing (campion, someone, higgs, 1993)
- everyone on my team does their fair share of the work
- no one in my team depends on other team members to do the work for them
- nearly all the members on my team contribute equally to the work
