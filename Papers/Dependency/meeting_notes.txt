# additions
- naylor calls it work structure
- shaw calls it cooperation requirements


1) Who is leading?

2) logical dependency

is it the commit that has greater dependence or the file?
- look at a file and its history
- in a 2 week interval, look at a file. How many times was a file changed in the same commit as another file?
on the file, not on the commit

a commit where everything got changed means everything gets +1 on index
commit where file A and B got changed = +1 on A and B
at the end, A has 5 interdependenceis because it was changed at the same time as other files 5 times. 


references
he has them

t-rex is a program for syntactic
he is sending me a paper (on failure rate)



3) other surveys from courtright meta


4) paper needs takeaway points

- theory and methods
- look to tables to find what you want
- therorize about tasks and measure tasks, or theorize about people and measure people
- multiple where possible
- begin research on the overlap between perceptions and theoretical indices

5) do we need to incorporate your other dimensions?

no



Daniel's stuff
- lost in taxonomy for outcome vs. task. receiving, inititating and reciprocal. clarify our taxonomy
- images (direct copies ok?)
- suggestion section at end




## survey and theoretical index split:

talk about overlap. Some of the indices you actually get from asking a supervisor. 




## taxonomy stuff

these are the categories you should be aware of
this is the language you need to have to discuss these things

this is just what people have done and something to consider
not a true taxonomy

you might just need headers:
task interdependence
outcome interdependence

review is uneven: need to talk about other indices perhaps a bit more.
