# A Taxonomy for Dependency

## Overview of the taxonomy	

Numerous measures of dependency have been used in the organizational literature; interestingly. Many of these indices are closely related. Others measure concepts that are very different. One of the core aims of this paper is to provide an objective framework which can identify and describe these similarities and differences in measurement of dependency, thus brining greater clarity to research. While there are many characteristics which could be used to differentiate indices of dependence, the proposed taxonomy uses four main characteristics: level of analysis, direct vs indirect, univariate vs bivariate, and core network characteristic. We begin discussion of the dependency taxonomy by providing a formal definition of dependency so as to clarify the construct in question. We then briefly discuss a network based representation of dependency and constructs related to dependency. We then discuss each of the four primary dimensions of the taxonomy. We conclude our discussion of the taxonomy by considering criteria which may be employed to evaluate a given indices usefulness. 

For the purpose of this paper we define dependency as or interdependency as \textit{A relationship between some object of dependency and source of dependency such that performance of the object is influenced by performance of the source of dependency}. We have found that a broad definition is necessary to capture the many forms that dependency takes. For instance these relationships of influence can be between tasks, or people, and have been described with various labels such as coordination, cooperation, collaboration.

It is startling to us that despite dependency's apparent importance to teams individuals and their outcomes, we have found no clear definition of dependency in the literature. For further clarity, it should be noted that dependency, as here defined, encompass various other team related constructs such as interdependency, cooperation, coordination, collaboration, and teamwork. Additionally this definition of dependency encompasses notions of inter-task structures and task assignment. There has been an effort to define or differentiate various of these sub-categories in the organizational literature. For an example, Bedwell et al. provided a review of collaboration measures differentiating collaboration from constructs such as coordination and cooperation (rrr). While work done to differentiate these closely related constructs is valuable we are focused on providing a theoretical framework which can be applied globally to these constructs to consider the broad patterns. 

The purpose of this paper is primarily to review indices of dependency, and many indices which have traditionally been applied to only one sub-domain of dependency may give valuable insight into methods which could be used in other domains. We believe that this approach will enable the study of broad patterns of how team composition and structure impact performance. We further suggest that this board conceptualization may serve as a unifying foundation that will enable research on specific subcategories of dependency to clarify their differential contributions, and suggest future avenues for research. Our aim is that this conceptualization aids collaboration between related areas of organizational research, bringing a unity that has hereto been difficult to find.

## Primary Dimensions of Dependency Taxonomy
The four primary dimensions of our taxonomy are as follows: 1) Level of Analysis, 2) Direct vs. Indirect, 3) Univariate vs. Bivariate, 4) Network Index. These dimension were developed from observations of natural ways to divide the existing measures of dependency used in the literature. We believe this taxonomy will serve as a good foundation to build on for future discussion about dependency measures. It is not our intent to claim that this list of dimensions is exhaustive in any way. 

### Index Level of Analysis:

Dependency is measured generally as either a characteristic of an individual or team. It is informative to distinguish between indices of dependence which measure an individual's dependence on external factors, and a team's overall dependence. Multi-level theorists have professed and demonstrated clearly the merit of having tools that enable a researcher to split a construct into organization, team, and individual level components of a construct (rrr). For example, in practice, an index measuring an individual's level of dependence may be a powerful tool which could be used in job design or selection. People that have a high degree of person-to-person dependency would require a socially skilled individual compared to people with little or no person-to-person demands. Indices of team level dependence may be more useful from a manager's point of view; a team that is has a high degree of dependency may need to be restructured so as to avoid potential problems.

To be clear, Index Level of Analysis refers to the level of analysis for the index itself. The objects or sources of dependency for relationships incorporated into a given dependency index may be, themselves, at the individual, team, or organization level regardless of the index level of analysis. For example an index may aggregate various dyadic dependency relationships in a team to a team level index. In this case the object and source would both be at the individual level for each dependency relationship, but the index which aggregates the impact of these individual level relationships to the team level would be at the team level. Additionally it should be noted that many individual level indices of dependency can easily be aggregated to the team level.

### Direct vs. Indirect:

Individual level indices have a central object of dependency. This is the individual to which the index applies. Direct indices only account for dependency relationships between this central object the sources it is dependent on. By contrast indirect indices incorporate dependency relationships that do not necessarily all have the same object of dependency. Team level indices usually incorporate relationships that have various objects of dependency so network level indices could be assumed to be indirect, however if the index is simply an aggregation of individual level measures, and the individual level index is a direct index in every case, then the aggregated network level index is also considered direct.

For an example consider the football team. An index of dependency which accounts for how much one individual is dependent on each of the other team members without regard to their own interdependencies would be a direct measure. The WR may have a high level of dependency in this index because they are completely dependent on the QB, but also highly dependent on other WR's performance (if other WR's performed well a different WR will have less pressure), and dependent on the performance of the running backs (a good running game means less pressure on the WR). An offensive line man, on the other, hand can perform well at their job regardless of just about everyone but the line men on either side of him and maybe the QB himself. This is an index of direct dependence.

A different index of dependency applied to the same team, may incorporate second and higher order dependency relationships. The line-man, according to this index, may have a different dependence score. The performance of the linemen is still dependent on the QB, but the QB is dependent on the WR's ability to catch and this relationship may impact how much the lineman is dependent on the QB. (Perhaps the better the WR performs the easier the QB's job, and in turn the easier the lineman's job.) This index is indirect because it incorporates dependencies that are not directly related to the central object (the lineman).

Note that a measure of the team's overall dependence aggregating the first dependency index across described above for the entire team would be a team level index of direct dependence. This is because it would be the aggregation of strictly direct dependency indices. In cases of aggregated team level indices, the index is only considered indirect if the individual level score that is aggregated accounts for more than only direct dependencies.

###  Univariate vs. Bivariate 
Indices of dependence may account for only dependency relationships between two tasks or two people such that all objects and sources of dependency relationships considered have the same type. When using a network perspective of dependency, the network for these indices have members of only one type (person or task). These indices with only one type of network member in the dependency network are univariate indices. By contrast, a bivariate index increases both tasks and people. The network implied by the dependency relationships used to calculate the index has members of both types (person and task).

A simple task assignment graph which describes how people are assigned specific tasks is likely the most basic form of a bivariate network. An index based on how tasks interrelate such that one task must proceed other tasks (such as in a waterfall diagram) form a univariate index because all members of the dependency network are of the same type. It is possible that an index could incorporate more types than task and person, however the indices we have reviewed have at most two object / source types.

### Network Characteristic:
Defining dependency as a relationship between individuals and/or tasks leads naturally to the use of a network perspective of team dependencies. The connections within these dependency networks are dyadic dependency relationships, and the nodes in the network are people and tasks. With the notable exception of self-report and observational measures, all indices of dependency we have encountered can be described in terms of the measurement of some characteristic of such a network. This fact is strong support for the theoretical importance of a network perspective of dependency. 

We find it surprising that despite how indices used in the literature can be naturally described in terms of a network, there is little direct mention of a network perspective of dependency or it's theoretical implications. Instead indices typically discuss dependency as a general team or individual level construct without refence to a network perspective. This is the case even in instances where network characteristics are central to the indict in question. We suggest that dependency may be better studied by explicitly exploring the theory of dependency networks. The network conceptualization of dependency has various implications which will be the work of future research to investigate. For the purpose of the present paper it is sufficient to note that the network characteristic that a given dependency indices measures makes a natural fourth criteria in our dependency taxonomy.

Identifying the central network characteristic used in an index of dependency important because it defines one element of how dependency is being conceptualized in the given context. For example, an index that is based primarily on degree-centrality will likely be concerned with how the demands of balancing many requirements and responsibilities impacts an objects performance. This index would not directly account for second order dependencies. A clustering based index, by contrast, would account for these second and higher order impacts of dependencies. This index could be very useful in evaluating the effects of concepts like intermeshed team task assignment.

While, the core network characteristic used in an index is clearly valuable to consider, and may be helpful in distinguishing dependency indices it has the potential to introduce some confusion for various reasons and must be appropriately. Specifically there is room for considerable ambiguity when evaluating a index's core network characteristics. An index of dependency may, for instance use more than one network characteristic in its computation. This would leave room for different interpretations of how the index is incorporated into the taxonomy. I may, for example, describe the dependency index "Clustering of Logical Dependencies" as primarily related to clustering, but a different researcher may be convinced that degree-centrality is actually more critical to how this index characterizes dependency. Both characteristics of the dependency network are used in calculating this index. Because of the ambiguity that can be present, it is important to be aware of the various network characteristics used to calculate an index when using the taxonomy to differentiate between indices. We suggest listing all important network characteristics.

The three network characteristics that we have found are most prevalent are density, degree-centrality, and clustering. We will briefly each of these characteristics and their implications on the measurement of dependency. It should be clearly note that there are many network characteristics could be incorporated into a measures of dependency, but to this point have not. Additionally, only the most common version of the given characteristics are described, indices measure a characteristic of the network related to but not identical to these characteristics.

#### Density:
Density is a measure of the ratio of connections in a network to total possible network connections. In terms of dependency, density is a fairly strong measure for the total number of dependencies compared to the size of the network. A dependency network with a high density is indicative of a team structure or task structure that has many dependency relationships per member of the network. Indices that are based on measures of density typically treat dependency as a team level construct where patterns of dependency is less significant than overall numbers of dependency relationships.

#### Degree-Centrality:

Degree-Centrality is a measure of how many nodes are connected to a specific node in a network. Degree-centrality may be used as a measure of a specific node's prominence in a network or it can be aggregated to measure the disparity between how connected nodes are within a network. A node in a dependency network with high degree-centrality may indicate a person or task that is likely to hold up team performance. Indices that use degree-centrality are concerned with how dependency relationships are distributed in a team not just how many there are.

#### Clustering:
Clustering is a measure of tendency of nodes to form clusters. There are variations on the concept, but the most basic clustering coefficient is the proportion of connected sets of three nodes which form complete triangles. This is linked to and sometimes referred to as transitivity. When one member of a network (call them A) is connected to a second (call the B), and likewise B is connected to a third member of the network (call them C) the clustering coefficient is a measure of how likely A is to directly connect to C.. Networks with a large clustering coefficient tend to form very distinct clusters with very few connections between the clusters. Highly clustered dependency networks may have more significant impacts from indirect dependency relationships because the nodes that impact a given nodes performance will likely impact each other's performance.

#### Path Length:
This is the measure of the shortest path between two nodes in a network. This is related to other network characteristics such as radius diameter, and girth. A dependency index that is based on path length in some form may be concerned with hierarchy such in a task pre-requisite hierarchy. The longer the path between two tasks the more room there is for something to break down.
