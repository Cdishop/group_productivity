# A Taxonomy for Dependency

## Overview of the Taxonomy	

Numerous measures of dependency have been used in the organizational literature. Many of these indices are closely related; others measure concepts that are very different. One of the aims of this paper is to provide an objective framework which can identify and describe these similarities and differences in measurement of dependency, thus bringing greater clarity to research. Table 1 provides examples of how all indices reviewed previously fit into the taxonomy.

## Dimensions of Dependency Taxonomy
The four primary dimensions of our taxonomy are as follows: 1) Level of Analysis, 2) Direct vs. Indirect, 3) Univariate vs. Bivariate, 4) Network Index. These dimensions were developed from observations  of existing measures of dependency in the literature and represent what we deem a natural categorization of dependency index characteristics. We believe this taxonomy will serve as a good foundation to build on for future discussion about dependency measures. It is not our intent to claim that this list of dimensions is exhaustive. 

### Index Level of Analysis

Dependency is measured as either a characteristic of an individual or of a team. It is informative to distinguish between indices of dependency which measure an individual's dependence on external factors and a team's overall dependence. Multi-level theorists have demonstrated the merit of having tools that split a construct into organization, team, and individual level components of a construct (rrr). For example, in practice, an index measuring an individual's level of dependence could be used in job design or selection. Positions that have a high degree of person-to-person dependency would require a socially skilled individual compared to positions with little or no person-to-person demands. Indices of team level dependence may be more useful from a manager's point of view; a team that has a high degree of dependency may need to be restructured to reduce coordination, cooperation, and collaboration costs. 

Index Level of Analysis refers to the level of analysis for the index itself. The objects or sources of dependency for relationships incorporated into a given dependency index may beat the individual, team, or organization level, regardless of the index level of analysis. For example, an index may aggregate various dyadic dependency relationships in a team to a team level index. In this case, the object and source would both be at the individual level for each dependency relationship, but the index which aggregates the impact of these individual level relationships to the team level would be at the team level. Many individual level indices of dependency can easily be aggregated to the team level.

### Direct vs. Indirect

Individual level indices have a central object of dependency - this is the individual to which the index applies. Direct indices only account for dependency relationships between this central object and the sources it is dependent on. By contrast, indirect indices incorporate dependency relationships that do not necessarily all have the same object of dependency. Team level indices usually incorporate relationships that have various objects of dependency, so network level indices could be assumed to be indirect; however, if the index is simply an aggregation of individual level measures and the individual level index is a direct index in every case, then the aggregated network level index is also considered direct.

Consider a football team. An index of dependency which accounts for how much one individual is dependent on each of the other team members without regard to their own interdependencies would be a direct measure. The wide receiver (WR) will likely have a high level of dependency in this index because they are completely dependent on the quarterback (QB), but also highly dependent on other WR's performance (good performance from one or more WRs will reduce pressure on the remaining WRs), and dependent on the performance of the running backs (RBs) (a good running game means less pressure on the WR). An offensive lineman's performance, on the other hand, relies on almost no one but the linemen on either side of him and maybe the QB himself. This is an index of direct dependence.

A different index of dependency, applied to the same team, may incorporate second and higher order dependency relationships. The lineman, according to this index, may have a different dependency score. The performance of the linemen is still dependent on the QB, but the QB is dependent on the WR's ability to catch and this relationship may impact how much the lineman is dependent on the QB. Perhaps the better the WR performs, the easier the QB's job, and in turn, the easier the lineman's job. This index is indirect because it incorporates dependencies that are not directly related to the central object, the lineman.

Because team level indices generally involve dependency relationships that do not all have the same object of dependency, we generally categorize team level indices as measuring indirect dependency. There are two exceptions for this general rule. First if the team level index is based entirely on a central figure such as a leader, and all dependency relationships incorporated into the index have this central individual as their object of dependency, we could consider this team level index a measure of direct decency. Measures of leadership involvement, for example could possibly fall under this category of team level measures of direct dependency. The second exception is for indices of dependency that are aggregations of an individual index of direct dependency. For example, if a team level index was based on averaging the number tasks a task is dependent on, this would be considered a team level index of direct dependency.
 
###  Univariate vs. Bivariate 
Indices of dependence may account for only dependency relationships between two tasks or two people, such that all objects and sources of dependency relationships considered have the same type. When using a network perspective of dependency, the network for these indices have members of only one type (person or task). These indices with only one type of network member in the dependency network are univariate indices. By contrast, a bivariate index increases both tasks and people. The network implied by the dependency relationships used to calculate the index has members of both types (person and task).

A simple task assignment graph which describes how people are assigned specific tasks is likely the most basic form of a bivariate network. An index based on how tasks interrelate in that one task must proceed other tasks (such as in a waterfall diagram) form a univariate index because all members of the dependency network are of the same type. It is possible that an index could incorporate more types than task and person; however, the indices we have reviewed have at most two object/source types.

### Network Characteristics
Defining dependency as a relationship between individuals and/or tasks leads naturally to the use of a network perspective of team dependencies. The connections within these dependency networks are dyadic dependency relationships and the nodes in the network are people and tasks. With the notable exception of self-report and observational measures, all indices of dependency we have encountered can be described in terms of the measurement of some characteristic of such a network. This fact is strongly supportive  of a network perspective on dependency. 

We find it surprising that despite how indices used in the literature can be naturally described in terms of a network, there is little direct mention of a network perspective of dependency or it's theoretical implications. Instead, indices typically discuss dependency as a team or individual level construct without refence to a network perspective. This is the case even in instances where network characteristics are central to the index in question. We suggest that dependency may be better studied by explicitly exploring the theory of dependency networks. The network conceptualization of dependency has various implications which will be the work of future research to investigate. For the purposes of the present paper, it is sufficient to note that the network characteristic that a given dependency index incorporates makes a natural fourth criteria in our dependency taxonomy.

Identifying the central network characteristic used in an index of dependency is important because it defines one element of how dependency is being conceptualized in the given context. For example, an index that is based primarily on degree-centrality will likely be concerned with how the demands of balancing many requirements and responsibilities impacts an object's performance. This index would not directly account for second order dependencies. A clustering based index, by contrast, would account for these second and higher order impacts of dependencies. This index could be very useful in evaluating the effects of concepts like inter-meshed team task assignment.

While the core network characteristic used in an index is clearly valuable to consider, and may be helpful in distinguishing dependency indices, it has the potential to introduce some confusion for various reasons and must be appropriately used. Specifically, when evaluating an index's core network characteristics, there can be considerable ambiguity. An index of dependency may, for instance, use more than one network characteristic in its computation. This would leave room for different interpretations of how the index is incorporated into the taxonomy. I  could describe the dependency index "Clustering of Logical Dependencies" as primarily related to clustering, but a different researcher may be convinced that degree-centrality is essential to how this index characterizes dependency. Both characteristics of the dependency network are used in calculating this index. Because of the ambiguity that can be present, it is important to be aware of the various network characteristics used to calculate an index when differentiating between indices. We suggest listing all important network characteristics.

The three network characteristics that we have found to be most prevalent are density, degree-centrality, clustering, and path length. We will briefly describe each of these characteristics and their implications on the measurement of dependency. It should be clearly noted that there are many network characteristics that could be incorporated into measures of dependency, but have not been. Additionally, only the most common version of the given characteristics is described. Note that indices incorporate a characteristic of the network related to but not always identical to these characteristics.

#### Density
Density is a measure of the ratio of connections in a network to the total possible number of network connections. In terms of dependency, density is a strong measure for the total number of dependencies compared to the size of the network. A dependency network with a high density is indicative of a team structure or task structure that has many dependency relationships per member of the network. Indices that are based on measures of density typically treat dependency as a team level construct where patterns of dependency are  less significant than overall numbers of dependency relationships.

#### Degree-Centrality

Degree-Centrality is a measure of how many nodes are connected to a specific node in a network. It may be used as a measure of a specific node's prominence in a network or it can be aggregated to measure the disparity between how connected nodes are within a network. A node in a dependency network with high degree-centrality may indicate a person or task that is likely to hold up team performance. Indices that use degree-centrality are concerned with how dependency relationships are distributed in a team, not just how many there are.

#### Clustering
Clustering is a measure of the tendency of nodes to form clusters. There are variations on the concept, but the most basic clustering coefficient is the proportion of connected sets of three nodes which form complete triangles. This is linked to, and sometimes referred to as, transitivity. When one member of a network (call them A) is connected to a second (call them B), and likewise B is connected to a third member of the network (call them C), the clustering coefficient is a measure of how likely A is to directly connect to C. Networks with a large clustering coefficient tend to form very distinct clusters with very few connections between the clusters. Highly clustered dependency networks may have more significant impacts from indirect dependency relationships because the nodes that impact a given node's performance will likely impact each other's performance.

#### Path Length
This is the measure of the shortest path between two nodes in a network. The path length is  related to other network characteristics, such as radius diameter and girth. A dependency index that is based on path length in some form may be concerned with hierarchy, such as in a task pre-requisite hierarchy. The longer the path between two tasks, the more room there is for something to break down.
