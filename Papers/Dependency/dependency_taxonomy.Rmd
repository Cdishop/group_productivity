# A Taxonomy for Dependency

## Overview of the taxonomy	

There are numerous measures of dependency which have been used in the organizational literature; interestingly. Many of these indices are closely related. Others are measuring concepts that are very different. One of the core aims of this paper is to provide an objective framework which can identify and describe these similarities and differences, thus brining greater clarity to research. While there are many characteristics which could be used to differentiate indices of dependence, the proposed taxonomy uses three main characteristics. We begin discussion of the dependency taxonomy by providing a theoretical representation of dependency and defining dependency in a formal way. We then discuss each of the three primary dimensions of the taxonomy. We will conclude our discussion of the taxonomy by considering other possible characteristics and both their potential merit and the reasons why they were excluded from our primary taxonomy. We suggest there is significant merit in considering all these characteristics when preparing to study the impact of dependency, as they may all impact the meaning of results and outcome of the study in significant ways. The three dimensions as follows: 1) Object Level of Analysis, 2) Source Level of Analysis, 3) Object-Source Type.

## Theory and Definition of Dependency

Though widely used Dependency and its counterpart interdependency is to this point undefined in the organizational literature. While the meaning of these two terms is arguably somewhat intuitive we suggest that formally defining dependency has merit in providing unity to the theory or organizational dependency.

We define dependency as a relationship between some object of dependency and source of dependency such that performance of the object is influenced by performance of the source of dependency. The object of dependency may be an individual, task, or group as will be discussed below. Likewise the source may be a task or person, and may be an individual or group.

The direct consequence of these relationships is that teams, and organizations have inherent dependency networks that are formed as the aggregation of these relationships between their individuals and or tasks. This network conceptualization of dependency has various implications which will be the work of future research to investigate. For the purpose of this  paper it is sufficient to note that, with the exception of self-report and observational measures, all indices of dependency are based on the measurement of some characteristic of this dependnecy network.

## Primary Dimensions of Dependency Taxonomy

### Object Level of Analysis:

Dependency is measured generally as either a characteristic of an individual or team. It is informative to distinguish between indices of dependence which measure an individuals dependence on external factor, and a team's overall dependence. For example in practice an index measuring an individual's level of dependence may be a powerful tool which could be used in job design or selection, whereas indices of team level dependence may more useful from a manager's point of view. Multi-level theorist have professed and demonstrated clearly the merit of having tools that enable a researcher to split a construct into team level and individual level components of a construct. 

### Source Level of Analysis:

Dependency relationships, as they have been described in this paper, have a source inanition to the object of the dependency. An individual (the object of dependency) may rely on another individual (the source) to do their job, or one task (the object) may be completely un-doable before another task (the source) gets accomplished. Just as the object of dependency can be individual, dyad, team or organization, the source could be any of these. For example bureaucracy and organizational climate may impose dependency constraints on a team. The source level of that dependency would be the organization. An individual member of a team may depend on the team to come to a consensus before they can start their job (team level source). Or individuals may rely on collaboration with each other (individual level source). 

We propose that just as different levels of analysis of the object of dependency could have important implications on the measure of dependency and should be acknowledged explicitly, the source level of analysis has important implications the impact of dependence and should be explicitly recognized. 

Object-Source Relationship Type: The third and final dimension of the dependency index taxonomy proposed in this paper is object-source type. This specifically refers to whether the objects and sources of dependency are people and the roles the fill or tasks. The task of longing into one's computer is dependent on the task of turning on the computer. Quite simply if the computer is not first turned on you cannot log on. This is an example of what, according to our taxonomy, would be described as a task-task dependency. In contrast to task-task dependency person-person dependency could be described in a situation where broadly speaking a team member may rely on another team to succeed themselves. This could be illustrated in the example of a wide-receiver and quarter-back on a football team. The wide-receiver's entire ability to perform their task is dependent on the quarterback doing their job. 

While person-person dependence could possibly be redefined in terms of the tasks that both individuals take part in converting it to task-task dependence, the distinction is useful. In some cases there are clear task relationships that require direct attention. For example, in computer development teams the task of programing one component of an application is highly dependent on the comports it builds off of. However this microscopic task focus may miss some of the nuances and overall impacts of interpersonal factors. Additionally to a task focus could become very cumbersome when trying to define all the specific tasks performed by roles and their dependencies. 

While measures of dependence that we have reviewed largely fall into one of the two categories described above (task-task, or person-person). There are two specific cases, which will be discussed below, that are somewhat unique. In each of these cases the measures consider how tasks performed by a specific individual are impacted by tasks performed by another individual. Thus the object of dependence is a person, however the source is both task and person. These metrics are interesting in that they account for the interdependency of team members in a deeper manor than the indices that only account for either tasks or person relations. 

## Additional Dimensions of Dependency Taxonomy

### Prescriptive vs Facilitative:

Above we discussed how dependency is a relationship describing what is required to enable a task to be accomplished or what factors influence an individual's ability to do their job. There are two forms that these relationships can take: prescriptive and facilitative. In a prescriptive dependency relationship the source must be present, available, or accomplished (depending on what form the source takes), in order for the object of dependence to be proceed. In facilitative dependency, the object's performance is increased by performance of the source.

To use the same example used above, in order to perform the task of logging into a computer one must first perform the task of turning the computer on. This is distinct from a facilitative relationship in that no matter how good an individual is at typing in their password they will never be able to log in to their computer without powering it on. For another example consider again the football team. The wide receiver is completely dependent on the quarter-back doing their job. In other words, the wide-receiver is proscriptively dependent on the quarter-back's performance.

The term dependence in many ways best describes prescriptive relationships, though not all dependency relationships in a team are prescriptive. On a business team that has a member in charge of sales and a member in charge of marketing, the job of the sales is not prescriptively dependent on marketing's performance. That is to say that if marketing completely stopped doing anything, sales could continue performing (assuming there are some loyal customers that already know about the product); however, it would be much harder. We argue this make up a facilitative dependency relationship. Sale's performance is facilitated by marketing's performance.

While the line between prescriptive and facilitative can get blurry, we suggest that this distinction adds grater clarity to the use and selection of dependency indices. Specifically we propose that prescriptive dependency relationships could have a significantly different impact on team outcomes such as performance. For instance, it seems reasonable to suggest that prescriptive dependency has an almost exclusively negative correlation with performance while facilitative dependency may have a more complex relationship. We also note that many of the indices of dependency used in organizational literature clearly fit into one of the two categories making the distinction relatively easy.

### Network Characteristic:

The indices of dependence found in the literature today could also be divided by the network characteristic most integral to the dependency index. For example O'Brien's collaboration is calculated using a concept closely related to network density. Workflow Dependency is based on network concepts of degree-centrality, and clustering of logical dependency is based on a clustering coefficient. Identifying the central network characteristic used in an index of dependency important because it defines how dependency is being conceptualized in the given context. For example, an index that is based primarily on degree-centrality will likely be concerned with how the depends of balancing many requirements and responsibility impacts and objects performance. A clustering or transitivity based index of dependency will account for second and higher order impacted of dependency relationships and thus can study more directly the effects of intermeshed team task assignment.

While, there is clearly an argument for identifying what network characteristics form the core conceptualization used by an index of dependence, there are various drawbacks that make us hesitant to include this as a primary criteria for differentiating indices of dependence. First, the vast majority of indices of dependence currently in use are observational or self-report measures. Most of these non-networks based indices of dependence simply do not characterize dependence as a network characteristic. Although most of the indices we discuss in this paper could be partly differentiated by their core network conceptualization, we are hesitant to suggest a criteria for dependence indices that is meaningless to the vast majority of uses. Second, this criterion would not meaningfully differentiate between many of the network based indices of dependence described in the literature. The reason for this is that there could be considerable ambiguity between which primary network characteristic is core to the indices conceptualization of dependence. I may describe the dependency index "Clustering of Logical Dependencies" as primarily related to transitivity or clustering, but a different researcher may be convinced that in-degree is actually more central to how this index characterizes dependency. Both characteristics of the person-task network are used, and while the name of this example may suggest one option, the actual equation used for calculating this index leaves considerable room for interpretation. It may be possible to identify a set of network characteristics that differentiate these dependency indices in an informative, consistent way, but this is not a given.

### Origin of Data: 

One last characteristic of indices of dependency that should be mentioned is the source of data, or more specifically how the data is collected. There are three main sources of data that we have identified: 1. Self-report, 2. Observational 3. Structural. Both self-report and observational sources of data are self explanatory. The third source of data comes from the structure of the team, team tasks, or task assignment network, and represent theoretical indices of the team structure itself. While interesting, and certainly worth noting, the origin of data is held from the taxonomy as a primary dimension because it does not represent a theoretical difference in how dependency is described as much as a note of researchers method selection. We will, however, use this distinction to organize our discussion of various measures of dependency in the following section.

### Summary:

The taxonomy proposed in this paper focuses on four characteristics of indices used to measure dependency. Dependency is a factor of team performance at all levels of analysis and the first two dimensions of the taxonomy which we discuss relate directly to the level of analysis of the object and source of dependency. The third dimension of the dependency taxonomy we propose is the type of object and source analysis by the index. Because a person's dependency can generally be resolved to dependency relationship between tasks that individuals perform this dimension is closely related to notion of level of resolution. The last dimension of the taxonomy we propose is based on the outcome of the dependency relationships. Are these dependency relationships prescriptive, in that the object of dependency cannot perform without the source performing, or facilitative, in that the object's level performance is will be largely impacted by the source performance. Lastly we suggest that it is informative to identify the core network characteristics used in a network based dependency index, but caution that it may not be useful to enforce this as an index differentiating criteria. We will, include a column in TABLE 1, that provides out best interpretation of the core network characteristic used in a dependency index, where appropriate.
