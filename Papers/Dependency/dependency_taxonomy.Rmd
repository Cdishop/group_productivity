# A Taxonomy for Dependency

## Overview of the taxonomy	

Numerous measures of dependency have been used in the organizational literature; interestingly. Many of these indices are closely related. Others measure concepts that are very different. One of the core aims of this paper is to provide an objective framework which can identify and describe these similarities and differences in measurement of dependency, thus brining greater clarity to research. While there are many characteristics which could be used to differentiate indices of dependence, the proposed taxonomy uses four main characteristics. We begin discussion of the dependency taxonomy by defining dependency in a formal way and discussing a network based representation of dependency. We then discuss each of the four primary dimensions of the taxonomy. We conclude our discussion of the taxonomy by considering criteria which may be employed to evaluate a given indices usefulness. 

For the purpose of this paper we define dependency as or interdependency as \textit{A relationship between some object of dependency and source of dependency such that performance of the object is influenced by performance of the source of dependency}. We have found that a broad definition is necessary to capture the many forms that dependency takes. For instance these relationships of influence can be between tasks, or people, and have been described with various labels such as coordination, cooperation, collaboration.

### Dependency Network
Defining dependency as a relationship between individuals and/or tasks leads naturally to using a network perspective of team's dependencies. The connections within these dependency networks are dyadic dependency relationships, and the nodes in the network are people and tasks. This network conceptualization of dependency has various implications which will be the work of future research to investigate. For the purpose of the present paper it is sufficient to note that many indices of dependency can be understood using dependency networks.

With the notable exception of self-report and observational measures, all indices of dependency we have encountered can be described in terms of the measurement of some characteristic of a dependency network. This fact is strong support for the theoretical importance of a network perspective of dependency. We find it startling that there is little direct mention of the network perspective of dependency. As we discuss the taxonomy of indices of dependency and later the indices themselves, we will further illustrate the perspective networks give to the study of dependency.

### Related Constructs and Concepts
For further clarity, it should be noted that dependency, as here defined, encompass various other team related constructs such as interdependency, cooperation, coordination, collaboration, and teamwork. Additionally this definition of dependency encompasses notions of inter-task structures and task assignment. There has been an effort to define or differentiate various of these sub-categories in the organizational literature. For example, Bedwell et al. provided a review of collaboration measures across fields of study in an attempt to clarify the construct of collaboration and distinguish it from related dependency constructs (rrr). While work done to differentiate these closely related constructs is valuable, we are focused on providing a theoretical framework which can be applied globally to these constructs. 

The purpose of this paper is primarily to review indices of dependency, and many indices which have traditionally been applied to only one sub-domain of dependency may give valuable insight into methods which could be used to measure dependency in other domains. We believe that this approach will enable the study of broad patterns of how team composition and structure impact performance. We further suggest that this board conceptualization may serve as a unifying foundation that will enable research on specific subcategories of dependency to clarify their differential contributions, and suggest future avenues for research. Our aim is that this conceptualization aids collaboration between related areas of organizational research, bringing a unity that has hereto been difficult to find.

## Primary Dimensions of Dependency Taxonomy
The four primary dimensions of our taxonomy are as follows: 1) Level of Analysis, 2) Direct vs. Indirect, 3) Univariate vs. Bivariate, 4) Network Index.

### Index Level of Analysis:

Dependency is measured generally as either a characteristic of an individual or team. It is informative to distinguish between indices of dependence which measure an individual's dependence on external factors, and a team's overall dependence. Multi-level theorists have professed and demonstrated clearly the merit of having tools that enable a researcher to split a construct into organization, team, and individual level components of a construct (rrr). For example, in practice, an index measuring an individual's level of dependence may be a powerful tool which could be used in job design or selection. People that have a high degree of person-to-person dependency would require a socially skilled individual compared to people with little or no person-to-person demands. Indices of team level dependence may be more useful from a manager's point of view; a team that is has a high degree of dependency may need to be restructured so as to avoid potential problems.

To be clear, Index Level of Analysis refers to the level of analysis for the index itself. The objects or sources of dependency for relationships incorporated into a given dependency index may be, themselves, at the individual, team, or organization level regardless of the index level of analysis. For example an index may aggregate various dyadic dependency relationships in a team to a team level index. In this case the object and source would both be at the individual level for each dependency relationship, but the index which aggregates the impact of these individual level relationships to the team level would be at the team level. Additionally it should be noted that many individual level indices of dependency can easily be aggregated to the team level.

### Direct vs. Indirect:

Individual level indices have a central object of dependency. This is the individual to which the index applies. Direct indices only account for dependency relationships between this central object the sources it is dependent on. By contrast indirect indices incorporate dependency relationships that do not necessarily all have the same object of dependency. Team level indices usually incorporate relationships that have various objects of dependency so network level indices could be assumed to be indirect, however if the index is simply an aggregation of individual level measures, and the individual level index is a direct index in every case, then the aggregated network level index is also considered direct.

For an example consider the football team. An index of dependency which accounts for how much one individual is dependent on each of the other team members without regard to their own interdependencies would be a direct measure. The WR may have a high level of dependency in this index because they are completely dependent on the QB, but also highly dependent on other WR's performance (if other WR's performed well a different WR will have less pressure), and dependent on the performance of the running backs (a good running game means less pressure on the WR). An offensive line man, on the other, hand can perform well at their job regardless of just about everyone but the line men on either side of him and maybe the QB himself. This is an index of direct dependence.

A different index of dependency applied to the same team, may incorporate second and higher order dependency relationships. The line-man, according to this index, may have a different dependence score. The performance of the linemen is still dependent on the QB, but the QB is dependent on the WR's ability to catch and this relationship may impact how much the lineman is dependent on the QB. (Perhaps the better the WR performs the easier the QB's job, and in turn the easier the lineman's job.) This index is indirect because it incorporates dependencies that are not directly related to the central object (the lineman).

Note that a measure of the team's overall dependence aggregating the first dependency index across described above for the entire team would be a team level index of direct dependence. This is because it would be the aggregation of strictly direct dependency indices. In cases of aggregated team level indices, the index is only considered indirect if the individual level score that is aggregated accounts for more than only direct dependencies.

###  Univariate vs. Bivariate 
Indices of dependence may account for only dependency relationships between two tasks or two people such that all objects and sources of dependency relationships considered have the same type. When using a network perspective of dependency, the network for these indices have members of only one type (person or task). These indices with only one type of network member in the dependency network are univariate indices. By contrast, a bivariate index increases both tasks and people. The network implied by the dependency relationships used to calculate the index has members of both types (person and task).

A simple task assignment graph which describes how people are assigned specific tasks is likely the most basic form of a bivariate network. An index based on how tasks interrelate such that one task must proceed other tasks (such as in a waterfall diagram) form a univariate index because all members of the dependency network are of the same type. It is possible that an index could incorporate more types than task and person, however the indices we have reviewed have at most two object / source types.

### Network Characteristic:
The last dimension to the proposed taxonomy is which characteristic of a dependency network are used to form calculate the index. Most of the indices used to measure dependence that are found in the literature today can be described as a calculation of some measure of a dependency network. When distinguishing indices of dependency, it is informative to consider the network characteristics that are most integral to these dependency indices. For example O'Brien's collaboration index is closely related to network density. Workflow Dependency (rrr) is based on network degree-centrality, and clustering of logical dependency is based on network clustering (rrr). 

Identifying the central network characteristic used in an index of dependency important because it defines one element of how dependency is being conceptualized in the given context. For example, an index that is based primarily on degree-centrality will likely be concerned with how the demands of balancing many requirements and responsibilities impacts an objects performance. This index would not directly account for second order dependencies. A clustering based index, by contrast, would account for these second and higher order impacts of dependencies. This index could be very useful in evaluating the effects of concepts like intermeshed team task assignment.

While, the core network characteristic used in an index is clearly valuable to consider, and may be helpful in distinguishing dependency indices it has the potential to introduce some confusion for various reasons and must be appropriately. Specifically there is room for considerable ambiguity when evaluating a index's core network characteristics. An index of dependency may, for instance use more than one network characteristic in its computation. This would leave room for different interpretations of how the index is incorporated into the taxonomy. I may, for example, describe the dependency index "Clustering of Logical Dependencies" as primarily related to clustering, but a different researcher may be convinced that degree-centrality is actually more critical to how this index characterizes dependency. Both characteristics of the dependency network are used in calculating this index. Because of the ambiguity that can be present, it is important to be aware of the various network characteristics used to calculate an index when using the taxonomy to differentiate between indices. We suggest listing all important network characteristics.

The three network characteristics that we have found are most prevalent are density, degree, and clustering. We will discuss what these network characteristics are and how they impact the meaning of an index after reviewing indices of dependency. We will also discuss other network characteristics that could potentially be meaningful in the study of dependency.
